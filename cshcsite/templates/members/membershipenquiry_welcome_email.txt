Hi {{ first_name }},

Thanks for contacting us. We're very pleased to hear that you're thinking about joining Cambridge South!

League hockey runs from September to March but we still offer some hockey over the summer. The best way to get involved with the club is to come along to the summer pay-and-play sessions on a Thursday night, 8-9pm at the University Sports Ground astrorturf pitch on Wilberforce Road. We play some informal knock-around mixed hockey, usually 5 or 6-a-side games on half pitches.

The sessions are open to anyone and cost 4 a time or 2 for students/unwaged but your first session is free. Let me know if you're intending on going and I'll make sure there's someone looking out for you to introduce themselves.

Regular squad training runs every Monday during the season, starting in September, 7-9pm at The Leys School astroturf. We have paid coaches running the sessions and it's free to attend so do come along.

Thanks again for getting in touch and look forward to meeting you soon,
