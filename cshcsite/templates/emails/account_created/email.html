<p>Hello {{ first_name }},</p>

<p>This is probably the moment you've been waiting for your whole life. And its finally here!</p>

<p>A user account has been created for you on the <a href="{{  base_url }}">Cambridge South Hockey Club website</a>. The first
    thing you'll need to do is activate your account by clicking on the link below:</p>

<p><a href="{{  base_url }}{% url 'registration_activate' activation_key=activation_key %}"><strong>Activate my account</strong></a></p>

<p>Once you have activated your account, you can sign in using the following credentials:</p>

<p>Email address: <strong>{{ email }}</strong><br/>
Password: <strong>{{ password }}</strong></p>

<p>You should probably <a href="{{  base_url }}{{ login }}">sign in</a> soon and then <a href="{{  base_url }}{{ password_reset }}">reset
    your password</a> to something you will remember.</p>
