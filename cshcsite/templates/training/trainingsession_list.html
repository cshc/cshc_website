            <h3>Squad Training</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Cambridge South runs professionally coached training sessions for men and women of all standards throughout the season from September to March at
        <a href="{{ long_road_url }}">Long Road Sixth Form College</a>. All training sessions are free to attend, for club members and newcomers, with no booking required.</p>
        <h4>Ladies' Squads</h4>
        <p>The ladies' teams train on Thursday nights. The Ladies' 3s and Ladies' 4s - including players new or returning to hockey - train from 7pm to 8.30pm, followed by the Ladies' 1s and Ladies' 2s from 8.30pm to 10pm.</p>
        <h4>Men's Squads</h4>
        <p>The men's teams train on Tuesdays nights, meeting at 7.15 to warm-up. All teams train from 7.30-9pm, divided into higher and lower teams each on half a pitch. The Men's 1s and Men's 2s continue until 9.30pm on the full pitch.</p>
        <h4>Goalkeeper Training</h4>
        <p>Both men's and ladies' training includes fortnightly dedicated training for goalkeepers, running in the first 45 minutes of the sessions before the keepers integrate with the outfielders for the remainder of the session. See the club calendar for the training schedule. Keepers should arrive early and be kitted up and ready for the start of the session.</p>
        <h4>1st Team Training</h4>
        <p>The Men's 1s and Ladies' 1s run a second hour of training from 8.30-9.30pm on Wednesday evenings, using half a pitch each. There is a supplemental fee for this session for 1st XI players (£40 for the season / £20 unwaged).</p>

                <h3>Summer Hockey</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Cambridge South also offers informal weekly hockey on Wednesday evenings year-round, including over the summer off-season, from 7:30-8:30pm at
            <a href="{{ long_road_url }}">Long Road Sixth Form College</a>.</p>
            <p>A typical session consists of a couple of small-sided knock-around games, each on a half pitch. The sessions are mixed men's and ladies' hockey and open to everyone. You don't have to be a club member to come along and new players are very welcome.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p>From April through August, additional sessions run at the same time on Tuesday evenings. In May, July and August, a third weekly session runs on Thursdays, also at 7.30-8.30pm in May and July and at 8.30-9.30pm in August, preceded by a basic skills and game session for beginners and players returning to hockey from 7.30-8.30pm.</p>
                <p>Tuesday and Thursday summer sessions are restricted to club members (or new players not affiliated to any club).</p>
            </div>
            <p>If you build up a thirst then there is usually a group of us going on for a drink or two afterwards at a nearby pub - a great way to get to know people in the club!</p>
            <p>If you'd like to play, either contact {% clubinfo_email 'SecretaryEmail' sec_name %} any time during the week prior to the session you wish to attend or else just turn up at the pitch and introduce yourself. The cost is &pound;4 or &pound;2 for students and the unwaged. If you're new to the club, your first session is free, as are all the Thursday beginner sessions!</p>
