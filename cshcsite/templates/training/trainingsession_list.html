            <p>Cambridge South also offers informal weekly hockey on Thursday evenings from 8:00pm to 9:00pm at
            <a href="{{ long_road_url }}">Long Road Sixth Form College</a> during the summer months.</p>
            <p>A typical session consists of a couple of 5 to 7 a-side games, each on a half pitch. The sessions are open to everyone, you don&#39;t have to be a club member to come along and new players are very welcome.</p>
            <p>If you build up a thirst then there is usually a group of us going on for a drink or two afterwards at a nearby pub - a great way to get to know people in the club!</p>
            <p>If you&#39;d like to play, either contact {% clubinfo_email 'SecretaryEmail' sec_name %} any time during the week prior to the session you wish to attend or else just
                turn up at the pitch and introduce yourself. The cost is &pound;4 or &pound;2 for students and the unwaged. If you&#39;re new to the club, your first session is free!</p>
