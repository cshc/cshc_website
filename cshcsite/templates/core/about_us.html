<p>
Cambridge South Hockey Club is based in the city of Cambridge, UK. The club runs three Ladies' league teams and five Men's league teams, playing on Saturdays during the season, along with a social Mixed team on occasional Sundays. We offer opportunities for both experienced players and those new to the sport to play at a level that suits them.</p>
<p>
This season we have moved to be the principal community partner for the brand new <a href="{{ long_road_url }}" title="Pitch details">pitch at Long Road Sixth Form College</a>, laid by the London 2012 pitch contractors. Our <a href="{{ cantabs_url }}" title="Club house location">club house</a>, shared with Cantabs RUFC, is situated immediately opposite, providing exciting opportunities to develop the playing and social side of the club.</p>
<p>
Players at the club cover a broad range of ages, from older school age to veteran, but with a significant portion drawn from the university, both undergraduate and postgraduate students, and from recent and not-so-recent graduates working in the Cambridge area. Many members have moved to Cambridge for work or study and contribute greatly to the friendly, social nature of the club.</p>
<p>
Recent seasons have seen some of the best performances in the history of the club, with the Ladies' 1st XI achieving promotion from Division 1 to the Premier division of the Cambridgeshire Ladies' League and the Ladies' 2nd XI following that up with promotion from Division 2 to Division 1. Both teams now play in the East Womenâ€™s League along with the new development Ladies' 3rd XI side.</p>
<p>
The Men's 1st XI have consolidated their status in the upper part of Division 3NW, edging the promotion places, whilst the Men's 2nd XI were promoted twice in three seasons to join the 1st XI in Div 3NW before dropping back to Div 4NW last year. The Men's 3rd XI have been joined by the promoted 4th XI in Div 5NW and our development 5th XI play in Div 6NW(S).</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
</div>

<img align="left" alt="CSHC Crest" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}media/crest.png" id="crest" />
<p>The detailed history of the Club has been lost in the mists of time, but we do know that it was formed in about 1935, originally as a company team for the paper manufacturer
Spicers, based in the village of Sawston (south of Cambridge). At some point the club &#39;left home&#39; and became Sawston Hockey Club, still based in the village and playing at
the grass pitches owned by Spicers. When league regulations demanded that clubs play their games on astroturf the Club was forced to move its home games into Cambridge, initially
based at The Perse School but more recently at The Leys School.</p>
<p>The move into the city eventually resulted at the end of the 1997/98 season in the Men&#39;s club deciding on a second change of name to Cambridge South Hockey Club with the
Ladies&#39; club following suit the next season.</p>
