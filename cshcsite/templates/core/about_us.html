<p>
Cambridge South Hockey Club is based in the city of Cambridge, UK. The Club currently runs two Ladies&#39; league teams and five Men&#39;s league teams, playing on Saturdays during
the season, along with a friendly Mixed team in an occasional Sunday league. This provides a range of standards across the Club and gives opportunities for both experienced players
and those new to the sport to play at a level that suits them.</p>
<p>Players at the Club cover a broad range of ages, from older school age to veteran, but with a significant portion drawn from the university, both undergraduate and postgraduate
students, and from recent and not-so-recent graduates working in the Cambridge area. Many members have moved to Cambridge for work or study and contribute greatly to the friendly,
social nature of the Club.</p>
<p>Recent seasons have seen some of the best performances in the history of the Club, with the Ladies&#39; 1st XI achieving promotion from Division 1 to the Premier division of the
Cambridgeshire Ladies&#39; League and the Ladies&#39; 2nd XI following that up with promotion from Division 2 to Division 1.</p>
<p>The Men&#39;s 1st XI have consolidated their status in the upper part of Division 3NW, moving closer to the promotion places, whilst the Men&#39;s 2nd XI were promoted twice in
three seasons to join the Men&#39;s 1st XI&nbsp;in Div 3NW. After winning back-to-back promotions to rise to Div 5NW the Men&#39;s 3rd XI suffered relegation in 2010/11 but
immediately won promotion as champions in 2011/12 to restore their position. The Men&#39;s 4th and 5th XIs continue to provide an accessible opportunity to play league hockey in Div 6NW(S).</p>

    <h3>History</h3>

<img align="left" alt="CSHC Crest" src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}crest.png" id="crest" />
<p>The detailed history of the Club has been lost in the mists of time, but we do know that it was formed in about 1935, originally as a company team for the paper manufacturer
Spicers, based in the village of Sawston (south of Cambridge). At some point the club &#39;left home&#39; and became Sawston Hockey Club, still based in the village and playing at
the grass pitches owned by Spicers. When league regulations demanded that clubs play their games on astroturf the Club was forced to move its home games into Cambridge, initially
based at The Perse School but more recently at The Leys School.</p>
<p>The move into the city eventually resulted at the end of the 1997/98 season in the Men&#39;s club deciding on a second change of name to Cambridge South Hockey Club with the
Ladies&#39; club following suit the next season.</p>
