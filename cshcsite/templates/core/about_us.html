<p>
Cambridge South Hockey Club is based in the city of Cambridge, UK. The club runs four ladies' league teams and five men's league teams, playing on Saturdays during the season, along with a social mixed team on occasional Sundays. We offer opportunities for both experienced players and those new to the sport to play at a level that suits them. A new junior section was formed in 2016, training on Saturday mornings before the senior games.</p>
<p>
In 2014 the club moved to the brand new pitch at <a href="{{ long_road_url }}" title="Pitch details">Long Road Sixth Form College</a>, laid by the London 2012 pitch contractors. Our <a href="{{ cantabs_url }}" title="Club house location">club house</a>, shared with Cantabs RUFC, is situated immediately opposite the college.</p>
<p>
Players at the club cover a broad range of ages, from teenagers to veterans, but with a significant portion drawn from the university, both undergraduate and postgraduate students, and from recent and not-so-recent graduates working in the Cambridge area. Many members have moved to Cambridge for work or study and contribute greatly to the friendly, social nature of the club.</p>
<p>
Recent seasons have seen some of the best performances in the history of the club, with the Ladies' 1st XI achieving promotion as champions at the end of the 2016/17 season to play in Division 2NW in the East Women's League for the first time. The Men's 1st XI were promoted as champions of Division 3NW and now play in Division 2S, joining the elite 'Top 5' division group of the East Men's League for the first time in the club's history.</p>
<p>
The Men's 2nd XI were promoted twice in three seasons before dropping back to Div 4NW. The Men's 3rd XI topped Div 5NW in 2016/17 and join the 2nd XI in Div 4NW. At the entry level of the leagues, the Ladies’ 4th XI and Men’s 5th XI provide hockey for a mix of old heads and new hands.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
</div>

<img align="left" alt="CSHC Crest" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}media/crest.png" id="crest" />
<p>
The detailed history of the Club has been lost in the mists of time, but we do know that it was formed in about 1935, originally as a company team for the paper manufacturer Spicers, based in the village of Sawston (south of Cambridge). At some point the club 'left home' and became Sawston Hockey Club, still based in the village and playing at the grass pitches owned by Spicers.
</p>
<p>
When league regulations demanded that clubs play their games on artificial pitches the club was forced to move its home games into Cambridge, initially based at the Perse School, then at a variety of pitches around the city before settling at Long Road in 2014.
</p>
<p>
The move into the city eventually resulted (at the end of the 1997/98 season) in the men's club deciding on a second change of name to Cambridge South Hockey Club with the ladies' club following suit the next season. Cambridge South Hockey Club (the men’s club) and Cambridge South Ladies’ Hockey Club, having historically been separate but increasingly-connected clubs, merged to form a single club in 2009.
