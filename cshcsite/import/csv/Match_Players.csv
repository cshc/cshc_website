Eds lemon socks and South pere et fils again rocking up post warm-up each attracted a vote.  Also on one was vote Rob, for his meddling with skipper Johnny Bs substitution plan. This had seemed simple enough, what with us playing a 4-3-3 formation and having 5-4-4 available in terms of personnel. After Robs interventions chaos reigned, with defenders in midfield and midfielders in attack. Fortunately for Rob, and possibly partly as a result of his substitution anarchy, Stuart then blew everyone else out of the water by re-entering the game clad in <a href=""http://twistsandtales.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/stevie-wonder.jpg"">Stevie Wonder sunglasses</a>. The next few minutes proved Stu is not a believer in the proverb <b>When you are in a hole, stop digging</b>, first replying to the question What are you doing? with the slightly gnomic Playing centre-forward, and then having slowly realised what his teammates were laughing about and why it seemed unusually dark for 4pm, proceeding to hand his shades on to Umpire Vicky (is this cricket?). The final indignity was an attempt to shift the blame onto a 6 year old by claiming Well, my son put them on me and I forgot they were there.","True",0
