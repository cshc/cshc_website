Loopy was busy this week keeping for the 2's as well as the 1's.  Ellie (right back), Rhiannan (left back), Pip (centre back) and Tracey (sweeper) made up the back four behind captain Vicky (right mid), Ley (left mid), Sam (defensive mid) and Charlie (attacking centre mid).  This weeks forwards were Lyn (left forward) and Kendra (right forward).  Overall the game was evenly balanced.  South passed well through the midfield and had plenty of attacking chances.  There were some cracking crosses into the D and South came close to getting a stick to them.  Unfortunately Ely managed to ""badger"" through our strong defence and slipped the ball past Loopy.  Also, Ellie nearly ended up with a ""cauliflower"" ear from a stray high ball from an Ely player.  However, South picked themselves up and the communication which had been strong in the start of the first half returned.  Even though South's legs were getting tired this added team support made all the difference.  South found a hole in Ely's defence and Ley fired the ball past the Ely keeper to earn the well deserved equaliser.  
In a nutshell, the seconds played very well and it was an encouraging start to the season.  Lets hope our determination to do well and continued hard work at training leads to a successful season for the 2's this year.

Johnny and Ian babysat the team's little Mel mascott (with her warm farmers' hat!) and there were even a herd of cows watching the game from over the fence!!
The first half started off well with Sarah, Lotty and Lou not being challenged too much in defence. The midfield of Vicky, Ley and Breeshey had their work cut out feeding lots of balls up to the attack with good width from Lyn on the right. By half-time, South were 2-0 up (goals by Charlie and Bex). Breeshey managed to out-run everyone on the pitch and fed the forwards dozens of good balls which could/should have been goal opportunities!
Kendra came on after half-time and immediately scored, before supplying an amazing cross for Bex to shoot another goal. The midfield continued to relentlessly pressure Ely and provide a solid link in South's team. Lizzie had a fairly quiet first half but saved every shot on goal from the second half, and Tracey cleared any threatening balls that came the defence's way.","Ladies' 2nds take a fine win at Ely","False","False",,1,"True","False",

After a pre-match nap in the sun, and an arrival just in time from Sam, Carla and Vicky B (!), we headed onto the pitch ready to continue our run.
The game started messily, with neither side playing their best hockey. During the first scrappy twenty minutes or so, neither side were particularly dominating the game. A collision in the South half where sweeper Tracey ended up on the ground with a St Neots lady on top of her brought a temporary halt to the game. Tracey hobbled off and after a quick huddle and a mental restart, South finished the first half much more strongly, playing better hockey and creating more chances. The game remained goalless at half-time but we were now playing confident hockey and were sensing a win.
A good half time talk by captain Vicky set us up for the second half. We were aiming to create more space by using the right hand side, and had the confidence to play around their back line who seemed to be sticking fairly firmly to the D. Perhaps they were playing the offside rule? We exploited the new self-pass rule from the off when Charlie went straight from the 'push-back' up the pitch, passing with Carla who sent the ball out wide to Ley on the right, who delivered a cross in which Bex neatly deposited in the back of the goal - result!! Great start to the second half.
Our defensive team soaked up any pressure from St Neots, who didn't manage to advance too far into South's half. They delivered some good balls out to our midfield who pushed up the pitch and released the forwards. Some more neat build up play resulted in a strike from Charlie from near the top of the D into the bottom left hand corner - 2-0! A combination of a new stick and Loopy's voice saying - go for the corners ..!
South kept pushing despite some somewhat rough treatment from St Neots who seemed somewhat put out that they were two goals down. On the stroke of the final whistle, St Neots managed to win a short corner. With all the opposition bar the keeper surrounding our D, the defence was under a lot of pressure. The first short was almost cleared out, but they managed to win another. A sharp strike from the top of the D hit Sarah A directly on her toe which meant her hobbling off (later confirmed as broken - get well soon Sarah!). The final short brought some cracking saves from Loopy, but eventually St Neots managed to scramble the ball over the line to claim a late consolation goal.
A good win for South in a tough game and a tough match environment. We are calling on as much support as possible for the home fixture later in the season. Everyone played well under the pressure, and we kept our heads and played a fair game which we should be very proud of under the circumstances. Hope all our injured players are OK, and looking forward to continuing our winning streak next weekend. ","Ladies' 2nds beat St Neots 4 by 2 goals to 1.","False","False",,1,"True","False",

It was a great all round team performance from South.

With captain and vice-captain returned from holidays, the South ladies started in a positive mood and with an attacking 3-4-3 diamond formation. The experienced back line of Ellie, Becca and Rhiannon provided a solid base behind the midfield diamond of Caroline (defensive holding mid), Georgie (attacking centre), Hayley (left mid) and Liles (right mid) who channelled effectively into the strong attacking trio of Tash, Alice and Kelly up front. This formation was quickly effective, with the middle third of the pitch being dominated by South players harrying for the ball, and often being able to steal passes at will to launch swift attacking moves into the opposition D. Within the first 2 minutes South had drawn a short corner, and taken another shot quickly after. This pattern continued throughout the first half, with South players rattling shots at the St Ives keeper, and then smothering any break-outs from the opposition team in response only to return to the St Ives D for more of the same. Half way through the first period, with South clearly on top (though still goalless) a left mid substitution allowed Ley to get a taste of first-team ladies hockey, and by the time the half-time whistle was blown South had notched up 9 shots on goal, and 4 further short corners - but were still at 0-0. St Ives, meanwhile, had yet to take a single shot, having only reached the South D twice in the entire half.
With Hayley back on for the start of the second period, South once again laid siege to the St Ives goal. With the new self-pass rules in mind, the forward players began to truly harrass the opposition defence, resulting in even more possession and attacking chances. The left side of the pitch was proving bountiful hunting-ground for South, with Hayley and Alice firing shots at the impressive (in skill and stature) St Ives keeper, and the attack drawing 5 more short corners as a result of their fluid ground play in the D and hitting the target 5 more times from open play. However the ladies left it late in the game to break the deadlocked scores, with Tash eventually putting them ahead on 67 minutes with a simple and effective strike in open play, and then Alice tapping home to make the final score 2-0 to the visitors.
Overall South played excellent hockey across the entire pitch, disrupting the St Ives possession, and as a result taking the ball early and high up the pitch. The statistics of 15 shots on goal, 9 short corners and only 2 goals give a reasonable indication of the ladies' primary areas for improvement, namely effective shooting and short-corner practice - but the general picture is encouraging and bodes well for the season. Special mention must go to Lou ""Loopy"" Tonkin for a performance in goal that was so impressively intimidating that the opposition declined to take a single shot at her goal, and to Georgie Harford for a ""Man of the Match"" performance in which she showed an exceptional work-rate, intelligent overlapping with her central midfield partner and steely dedication to her team - some evidence for which might be found in the St-Ives players' bruises following her tackles.
The ladies will approach the next match at home against Hunts 1 in an optimistic mood.

After a rousing pre-match chat from captain Ellie the game started in an even-stevens fashion with plenty of good hockey but not many chances. Nomads eventually broke the dead lock halfway through the first half when a scramble in the circle eventually ended with the ball being poked in from a melee.
South almost scored immediately after the restart but couldn't quite put the ball away after a good break down the left with Kendra and Tash. Lizzie meanwhile showed her goal keeping prowess defusing a one-on-one with a Nomad forward who'd sneaked in behind the defence.
The general pressure though was swinging South's way with sustained pressure on the Nomad's D. Georgie in particular was tormenting the centre of defence with mazy runs in. One of which lead to the equalizer as her shot was tapped in by Tash on the line (poached or vital deflection? who's to say?). This was quickly followed by another chance as Kendra's shot was stopped by a foot on the line but Rhi's penalty flick was well saved.
Despite the concerted pressure Nomad's looked dangerous on the break, one such three-on-two lead to a second goal when a shot in from a tight angle was touched home with a point blank range deflection.
Two-One down at half time but playing well.
The half time oranges obviously had the desired effect as the second half started with a rapid attack down the right from Kelly putting a dangerous ball across the circle and unlucky not to get the final touch. Tash also had a shot well saved. South pressure mounted and was rewarded when Liles drove into the D and put a beautiful ball across the goal which was finished with great aplomb by a Nomad's defender.
South continued to press forward and had chances but without reward.
Whilst Nomad's were forced to settle for occasional breaks, with defence bending but never quite breaking as Ellie, Julie, Rhi and Becca all covered for each other and put in good tackles at vital moments, and feeding balls up to the midfield dynamo that was A.I. and George.
Inspired by the captains cry of ""Come on girls, we need one more to win this"" (one can tell she's a PhD student), South won a short and showed the benefit of the Thursday practices as Kelly's first time strike was deflected by Tash to Becca who tapped in at the post to put South ahead for the first time.
Nomad's began to have a little more pressure as the game closed but were given no clear cut chances whilst South had a couple more chances and won a succession of short corners that nearly produced results but for frantic last ditch defending.
A really satisfying win in a well contested, good spirited game leaving South top of the table as the only undefeated team in the division and looking forward to keeping it up for the rest of the season.","Ladies' 1sts come from behind to beat Cambridge Nomads","False","False",,1,"True","False",

South dominated from the outset with smart, passing hockey.  Georgie's natty dribbling made space for a smooth lay off to Alice who nailed her first goal without delay.  More pressure followed and the same double act came good again with Georgie sharp on the rebound of Alice's strike and getting number two for the day.  Newmarket rallied a little in the second quarter and spent some time in the Cambridge half, but their efforts were dealt with promptly by defence and midfield with Hayley, Liles and AI linking beautifully with the forward line and even passing the ball around the back from time to time!  Back in the opposition half, there were plenty of chances for Cambridge who found depth with Kendra on the left Tash on the right, including some agonising near misses for Alice, lurking on the penalty spot and whizzing ball after ball millimetres wide of the right post.  One of the smoothest goals of the match came from a super-hard strike from Alice, sneakily deflected behind the keeper by Tash on the right post.  Three - nil to South at half time.
Newmarket came back with renewed vigour (and sharpened elbows on their defenders!) but Cambridge had more.  Alice broke her duck and swept a lovely goal in from the penalty spot within the first minute of the half.  Newmarket's hard through balls consistently failed to find a player to recieve them and, again, most of the play was in their half.  New to the 1s, Lottie played strongly on the left, linking with Julie and AI who formed a great partnership, best demonstrated by a deadly accurate pass from Julie across the D, through the defenders' legs to AI who hammered it home.  Having got a taste for scoring, AI got the next one too, a product of sharp reflexes on the near post.  Newmarket gave the defenders some work to do, but Rhi did a great job to keep the Cambridge half safe.  More pressure in the D, including a slightly disappointing set of unconverted short corners, led to the flashiest goal of the match:  Alice's tight-angled uppercut ball was further deflected and whizzed into the top corner of the net.  For all the impressive work in the opposition D, however, perhaps the most glorious play of the match came right at the end when a rare Newmarket break left keeper Lou down at full stretch having saved a 1-on-1 and Vicky swept the ball off the line in a heroic move that kept a clean sheet for Cambridge.  The strength of the midfield and passing play with the forwards was what won the match and this was reflected in votes for Hayley and Tash and eventual crowning of Alice and Georgie as joint players of the match for this week.

In a game they had to win to advance due to Huntingdon's superior goal difference from earlier matches, South signalled their intent from the start, attacking straight from the opening push back. In a frantic start it was South who had most of the pressure but couldn't convert. AI in particular was unlucky not to get on the end of cross unmarked from Tash after a great run down the right wing.
Huntingdon managed several breaks and won the game's first short in slightly fortuitous manner but were unable to convert. The pressure from South continued but they also couldn't convert their own first short corner. The deadlock was broken shortly afterwards though as Hayley finished off a lovely passing move to make the score 1-0. 
South were unlucky not to double their lead on the stroke of half time as they got a short and from a second strike Alice received the ball in front of the keeper popping the ball through her own legs to Tash who tapped in on the right post only to have the goal disallowed due to obstruction.
Shortly after half time it was 2-0 as Alice took a quick free hit square to AI whose first time pass went to Kendra at the top of the D; her shot was blocked but Tash was on hand to put the rebound in. And two quickly became three as AI picked up a loose ball in the middle of the pitch and made a strong run diagonally towards the right corner before squaring to Alice at the top of the circle whose powerful shot left the keeper stranded. South had more chances as both Georgie and Liles made strong runs.
At this point Huntingdon suddenly found another gear and managed their first period of sustained pressure. However the backline of Ellie, Julie, Becca and Rhi managed to hold them off without offering any shots for Lizzy to deal with. Eventually though a short corner was conceded and after an extended pause to fix the keeper's kickers the South defence didn't restart as fast as the Huntingdon attack and couldn't quite clear the ball eventually allowing an unstoppable clean strike from the top of the D making the score 3-1.
South never quite found their earlier rhythm and the last ten minutes passed nervously with Huntingdon dominating and South breaking occasionally but neither team looking like scoring.

The South team included some new faces and others playing out of position but the group gelled well.  Strong passing play in the midfield kept South in possession of the ball and there were some strong attacks on the D.  Goals were hard to come by though, not least because of the strength of March's experienced central defender who stole ball after ball from an increasingly frustrated front line.  Once again, short corners were a weakness for South who had too many awarded to them to count, but no goals as a result.  However, the reward came eventually when new player Kirsten scored stylishly with a first-touch strike to a rebounding ball from the edge of the circle.  
There was always a risk the match could be lost by a sneaky goal from March so South entered the second half with renewed determination to nail the match.  Breeshey, playing out of position at right back, dealt effectively with some dangerous breaks from March, using her attacker's skills to drive forward, taking the March defenders by surprise and threatening goal more than once in a performance that earned her the Man of the Match award.  Most of the time, though, the play stayed well inside the opposition half, thanks much to Georgie and her ability to get in the way of almost any ball coming down the middle and Julie's equal efficiency on the left.  Repeated efforts from AI, Lyn, Liles and Tash went unrewarded.  The second goal of the match was a lesson in passing play with Liles sending a strong ball from the sideline to Georgie, who passed on into the circle for Kirsten to slot to Kendra for an efficient finish.  
Another good performance from South, but frustration at the lack of goals given the time spent inside the opposition's 23.  Loopy and Ellie got the Ice Maidens award after a quiet game at the back left them shivering while Georgie and Kirsten (we can't believe Keith kept her hidden so long) got well deserved votes for Man of the Match behind Breeshey.

So it was a case of getting shirts on, keeper clad and away.  It was a marked contrast to the coach-drilled, multi-subbed City 4s team that we were facing.  
The first half started with commendable enthusiasm and attacking play from South with goals justifiably following.  The first was a testament to sharp reflexes as a rebounded ball was snuck onto the backboard by Tash, lurking on the right post.  Not long after, a well timed lay-off from Georgie found Alice near the edge of the circle and she let no time go to waste, slapping it straight past the keeper in a stylish manner.  The goal record might have suggested South had all the play, but that wasn't the case: City, encouraged by many and vocal supporters, put in some good attacks but were repeatedly thwarted by the defensive line.  Kathryn, playing in defence for the first time this season and a debutante in the 1s, deserves particular mention for hard work and skillful play on the right, earning herself a man of the match nomination.  After a slightly frenetic ten minutes of battling mid-field play, South got themselves properly organised and put pressure on the City D once more.  Good passing play set Kirsten up for a strong shot on goal, duly finished, so that we were 3-0 up at half time.  
Moving into the second half with Kendra injured (not that you'd have noticed) and no extras, South faced a gee'd up City team with some suspiciously good subs.  With the knowledge that our keeper Sarah was somewhat inappropriately dressed (expensive new kickers popped off whenever she walked) the South defenders put in a committed performance to maintain a clean sheet.  Kirsten deserves particular mention for finding a jet-pack to double back and save a particularly scary, fast piece of break-through play.  Ultimately though, South dominated and sustained pressure on the D was rewarded by a goal: an awesome solo performance from Georgie, who weaved through opposition players to the edge of the circle before making space out of nowhere and scoring a straight strike into the back corner.  
Another great result for the South ladies.  Georgie was awarded Man of the Match for great work in attack and defence but the whole team deserved reward for this result. ","Ladies' 1sts win again against Cambridge City 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

As last week, the Rutland team were well drilled with strong stick skills and a determination.  This led to a somewhat flustered first ten minutes during which the South defenders had to work hard.  However, before long South regained their composure and it paid off well when sharp passing from all in midfield and landed Alice with the ball in the centre of the D which she duly hammered home.  Shortly after, sustained pressure was rewarded with a short corner and a lovely move sent the ball to Liles on the right then back to the penalty spot for Hayley to fire past the keeper.  Rutland kept coming back strong but good marking, hard work from the midfield, and (yet again) a heroic swoop onto a threatening ball by Julie, meant they couldn't convert any of their chances.  South were guilty of keeping to the centre and right of the field during the first half.  Towards the end, however, Caroline provided a persuasive argument to use the left when she dribbled the ball into the D, around several defenders, past the keeper then calmly slotted it into goal.   
In the second half South maintained strong pressure on the opposition D and held the midfield more strongly.  Goals were slow coming, despite some lovely crosses (persistently whizzing millimetres from players heading towards the left post) and other unconverted opportunities.  Liles and Hayley continued their short corner masterclass with a matching goal to that scored in the first half and Tash finished the match with a stylish goal which once again was the product of quick reflexes and accurate passing around the circle.  
Another excellent result from the Ladies 1s who continue on course to promotion.  All credit goes to Rutland for putting up a strong fight and giving the defence lots of work to do.  There were well deserved player of the match nominations for Caroline, AI, Julie, Kathryn and Georgie but Hayley was the well deserved recipient of the award for her combined sweeping and goal scoring game.

Before we knew it we were one nil done from a little shot that appeared to come off the post.
Despite going one-nil down South's play was still treacle like, until a quickly taken 16 hit caught Wisbech on the break, JJ picked the ball and found the tireless David Doupe who took the ball inside the D and duly made it 1:1 with a shot into the corner of the goal.  Wisbech was still having more of the midfield and South dound themselves 2:1 were down after a well taken shot corner.  That was then followed by a forced shuffle of the team as Ky Ho dislocated a finger and swapped with JJ Clark, who started to play in defence and Ky played upfront for the 1st time in 20 years.  Where are those subs when you need them ?  Then that followed a strange period where Wisbech got 2 more goals with South appearing to do much to stop them.  The last 7 minutes or so of the half ended with South finally finding their touch and started to string some attacks together with David Doupe at his threatening best and John Parker somehow finding himself supporting the forwards.
The second half was better for South and despite Wisbech having more possessions, they could not get the ball past David Bridge who has grown in confidence and even started to harass the forwards.  South always threatened to score and eventually Ian Evans managed to scramble one in, so we were now winning the second half!
South had further chances through Ian Evans and John Parker interspersed between David Bridge's saves, but 2 very late goals by Wisbech have them a flattering score line.

Peterborough looked a young and skilful side from the outset, but South was able to match them with a confident start to the match which soon saw Will Jones scoring a debut goal for South from a good shot after some good passing. South was to have another couple of chances having had the better of the first 20 minutes.
The pace of the game took its toll on the South players and Peterborough began to come through the midfield more and they equalised with a good shot in the air that went across the goal.  South could not contain them and Peterborough got another to make it 1:2.  The break couldn't come quick enough.
The half team talk was all about slowing it down, disciplined with the marking.  This did work and Peterborough was held at bay and South got a good equaliser when JJ Clark played a cross field pass to Shahzad in space who passed it first time into the D and James Raikes finished with a reverse stick flick, 2:2.  Again South had 2 more chances, both from James Raikes, but they were saved or just missed the goal.
A slip up in the tight marking was enough to let Peterborough in to make it 2:3. Peterborough made it 2:4 on the break as South pushed for an equaliser.
It was a good game and played at a level that the 4th team should be playing at every week. This should provide the incentive for all the players to get fitter.

South then had a few chances of their own, but not being able to put them away.  David Doupe's shots always seemed to be just wide of the post and Rob Barton was too well marked to be able to get his shots away.
South went 2:0 down after a quickly taken free hit just outside the D caught everyone off-guard.  The flood lights then started playing up, but the teams decided to continue 'til half time and re-assess.  A miss-hit by an Ely player was deflected past Boris for a 3rd.  In darkness, South finished the last 5 minutes the better side.
The half time team talk was all about defending further up and not allowing certain players to induce more short corners and this was effective with Shahbaz doing a disciplined job on the right winger.  The tighter midfield was winning more of the ball.  First goal came from a David Doupe shot deflected in by Ian Evans, 3:1.  The second goal came from a David Doupe shot deflected in by Shahzad Ali 3:2 and the third goal was a David Doupe shot that went into the goal directly 3:3.

Rob turned one way then the other before a steady strike put the ball past the keeper.  Although the home defence kept chances to a minimum, South were on top at this early stage and it was no surprise when the visitors went 2-0 up.  The second goal was the end of a string of good passes which culminated in Stuart dribbling past the final two defenders to make space for a shot.  His efforts to score were twice thwarted by the goalkeeper only for Rob to strike the rebound firmly in at the third attempt.  By this time, the South defence were pushing up effectively to maintain the pressure, with John Sharp and David in particular finding themselves in advanced territory.  Tim Dean was not troubled much in the first half, mostly due to strong midfield and defensive play, with Ian, Nick and Jack sustaining the core.  Just before the break, South were unfortunate not to be awarded a penalty stroke when a strike from a penalty corner, which hit a foot on it's way past the keeper, was deemed by the umpires to be just missing the target.  From the repeated corner, another shot found a defensive foot on the line and this time a stroke was awarded.  Unfortunately, to his dismay, Tristen's raised flick struck the corner of left hand post and crossbar with the resulting dong resonating into half time.
 In the second half St Ives realised they had to compete more to stand a chance of earning anything from this match and stepped up their efforts bringing the game to the visitors.  For much of the next period, a more even contest was found and at times South struggled to keep on top seeming to drift in and out of the play.  Renewed pressure on the South defence told and a home forward was able to squeeze the ball past Tim in the South goal from a tight angle.  So 2-1 it stood with little over 20 minutes to go, leading potentially to an anxious climax.  Fortunately, this wake-up call kick started South again who, like the proverbial phoenix, came bounding back with style.  The final quarter of the match saw a series of waves of attacking play foraging deep into the Saints' 25 metre zone mostly through South's wide men of John and Boris, both of whom were having strong games.  The final goal game from a penalty corner when the ball was slipped left to Rob who had time to pick his spot against a stranded keeper.  There was a collective sigh of relief as the ball hit the backboard and South knew the game was won.

Stu Creed and Andy Lewis particularly never gave up, but too many moves foundered before the killer pass could be made
After the break, with the midfield playing more together, and the home team passing better and earlier, Wisbech began to get a bit desperate, and the only goal came from a smartly taken Creed hit to John Greaves, who threaded the ball through the defence for the lurking Paul South to spin and shoot. 1 - 0
Thereafter CSouth were on top, displaying none of their pre-season fatigue, and ended the game well.

Up to that point CSouth had played well, with 3 well taken goals of their own from smoothly executed short corner routines, scored by Andy Lewis, Jack Chalk, and Paul South.

Spalding came back strongly, and pressure was rewarded when they won a penalty flick after some delicate defensive footwork on the line. 
CSouth battled back after the break, and gained another equaliser through a James Hodge forward defensive push down from chest level, showing great presence of mind to go with his boundless energy finding space throughout the game. Paul South then pounced on a rebound off the keeper after another well worked CSouth short corner to take the lead. This time Spalding came back on the break, scything through at pace via a defence splitting pass.

Late on in the game with both teams looking for the winner, it was CSouth who looked the better team, with numerous sweeping moves featuring Tom and Paul South, Andy Lewis, particularly. The balance brought about by using the width, fiesty ball winning in midfield, and intelligent teamplay was good to see, and got its just desserts with a John Greaves brace to wrap up the win.

South equalised immediately as James Hodge pounced on a Tristan Knight pass. Sadly Deeping scored again before the break as another attacker found acres of space, to shoot calmly into goal. 
The third away goal was more of the same as South lost some team discipline and reverted to old habits of giving the ball away, and not tackling effectively - apart from Paul South and Dom Nelson, who kept on demonstrating how it should be done. The home side got a goal back as James Hodge got the ball in to John Greaves who slid the ball past the keeper just inside the far post from close to the penalty spot.

Newmarket cranked up the pressure, with their star number 11 starting to dominate with stick and mouth.

No easy task. Simon Jelley slotted in to right back , keeping his position and linking well with the mid-field pairing of Dave Aston and debutant DMck. 
At half time the score was 0-0. Spalding took the lead almost immediately after the restart. It was a short corner; out to the top of the D and a quick hit that dipped over Shabhaz, who had quickly got into the logging position to defend the set piece. The ball was sent flying into the backboard. Spalding had made advantage of substitutes whereas Cambridge had only 11 players. Because of this, Cambridge were starting to tire, not helped by injuries to the rampaging Dom Nelson (knee), David Aston (cramp), and skipper John Greaves (upended by the keeper, and landing on his head). 
Spalding were a physical, robust team and were pushing the boundaries of legal play. At one stage Andy Lewis was on the edge of the D and was sent flying by a defender who was lucky to be only green carded. Cambridge then got a few short corners, one of which with 10 minutes to go, won by Andy Lewis, saw a sweet example of the old GreavesLewis routine  from which Lewis smashed the ball past the keeper into the back of the goal.  
This gave CSouth renewed spirit, and the game heated up. With two minutes to go a miracle happened.. Neil Snead hit the ball down the centre to Dom Nelson who got tracked down by a defender.

In the first ten minutes, Cambridge South were the dominant side, keeping the ball in their opponents half. They had several chances. John Greaves had two great attempts, but both just skimmed the outside of the post. Andy Lewis had a couple of efforts, and Rupert Espley and James Hodge were pushing hard down their respective wings to offer the forwards a chance at goal. The Nomads side were rocking at this point and it is a pity Cambridge South could not capitalise. The defence kept its composure and stopped the Nomads forwards from getting through on goal, it was good to see John Benedikz back in the side. South and Nomads used substitutes well and ended the first half 0-0. 
Almost immediately after the re-start Nomads took the ball forward and scored. David Bridge commented, tongue in cheek, that as a result of him not being on the pitch at this point, the defence was not quite so strong!  Tom South had a couple of mazy runs, but was probably suffering form a hectic (sporting he claims) schedule. South the Elder was his usual combative self, and his mid-field partner, Stu Creed was also full of running and tried hard to provide the forwards with chances to score - as well as discussing the finer points of the game with the umpires.  Once Man-of-Match Tim Dean, was given an opportunity to drive the team forward from defence, he did so with tenacity and verve. 
In spite of some rejigging of the positions. CSouth were undone by a rejuvenated Nomads side who once they took the lead did not look like a side who would let it go easily. They had a nice blend of talented young players and some more experienced players. 
A Nomads player commented afterwards that CSouth should have been more patient, and pay the ball across the pitch more. We had thought of this ... but somehow didnt actually implement such a cunning idea. He also admitted that the Nomads side included 2 or 3 players more used to a higher league. Sadly this didnt make us feel much better about failing to grab the points in a game that should have been a home win.

The fact that Newmarket got grumpier with the umpiring helped too, as CSouth managed to remain calm.     
All the goals were team efforts; the first from an Andy Lewis cross to Rupert Espley lurking as planned near the post to poke the ball in.

After half time the good work continued. Skipper John Greaves, recovered from a bang on the jaw, received the ball from Paul South in space, and rounded the keeper before slamming it inside the far post for the third goal. By this stage CSouth, building on the rock solid TSouthSneadLee defence were dominant, and Shabhaz Ali made the few necessary saves as confidently as always. The defenders - particularly the deceptively skillful Tom South - even took turns to surge upfield whenever possible, providing attacking options, and helping to solve a perennial 3rd Team problem of insufficient support players available to receive passes. Tom's alter ego Paul South, hampered by most of his body parts seemingly creaking or siezing up, still managed to tackle ferociously, and distribute the ball calmly, assisting midfield maestro Tristan Knight to run the show.

It rained, and in almost every department of the game the home team were superior. That's why Boston have already secured promotion, so the 3rds wont have to go there for at least a whole season.  
CSouth battled away for the whole game with an unfamiliar team trying to play good sensible hockey. Boston got two first half goals, the first with the aid of a fine deflection off a defender wrongfooting the keeper, and the second from a rebound after the initial shot off a short corner was saved. These were both unlucky, particularly for Shabhaz Ali, who produced his usual quota of dazzling saves, and the defence of BenedikzAgarwalaGloverEvans who were constantly trying to switch play with calm and skillful play across the back to change the point of attack. This initiated many good passing moves as everyone got the hang of passing and moving into space. 
Unfortunately Boston normally got to the ball first, and their combination of speed , nous, and skill made real chances rare for CSouth. Those that Messrs Lewis, Greaves, and South particularly managed to prise out were saved by the excellent Boston goalkeeper and his beefy but grumpy defenders, who were equally effective in open play and from the many CSouth short corners. It was really good to win more short corners than in earlier games, through good incisive moves into the D, but sadly none were converted . 
CSouth as usual didn't give up, with Hodge and newcomer JJ Clarke showing the way to the end, with Paul South and Wilco Dijkstra always making themselves available for the ball.
This was a game where CSouth probably played as well as they were allowed to, with nothing to be ashamed of. We go into the last weekend of the season needing, and expecting, good results in the final two games.

In a disjointed first half, all of the pace, passing and movement which had undone the 1sts earlier in the pre-season, and was on show again against Royston was missing.  This was epitomised by the Stortford keeper spending much of the half sunbathing on the backboard and their sub pointing out to acting Kaptain Kev on one move which involved possibly the longest dribble outside a nursing home that ""your right wing wanted that pass about half an hour ago"".  
Thankfully, Stortford weren't able to capitalise. A bit of last ditch defending, one sharp Shahbaz save from a snap shot and some loose short corners kept the score at 0-0. 
Eventually South did manage to string more that two passes together, but only twice.  The first resulted in the outside of the post being struck after Jack Chalk's good work around the back.  The second ended in Bav striking the ball into the right side of an empty goal after the keeper and defenders had all been drawn left to give South a bit of an undeserved lead at the interval.
A half time barracking from Kaptain Kev paid dividends and a more fluid South woke up in the second half looking like the better side.  A hustling Bav caught out the defence when he quickly fired a free hit into the path of an unmarked Rob Barton to make it 2-0.  That should have put the game safe but the flood of goals didn't come.  
A golden opportunity to make it 3-0 was spurned, and several other good chances became half chances when play dropped back to walking pace, and one short corner was reversed for time wasting.  Whilst there was little to suggest they would get back into the game, that gave Stortford the incentive to up their game and eventually one of numerous short corners was slotted in at the near post to leave the score at 2 - 1.  The last 5 minutes were an unnecessary frantic scramble.
If the win over the 1sts was champagne hockey, this was more like grape juice.  Not vintage Cambridge South 2s, more brutish than Brut.
After the game acting Kaptain Kev revealed he had in fact sacrificed his Spurs v Man Utd ticket to captain the game, a decision which rather than earn rapturous applause from his comrades was deemed lemon worthy, despite Sanjay declaring to all and sundry that he had broken his hair band...

The omens were not looking good early on, with no regular goalkeeper being available due to injury and most of the team stuck in an enormous tailback on the A14 less than an hour before pushback.  Those expecting the culprit to be Captain Dave Astons Rover 25 bursting into flames were disappointed to see that it was caused by a boat falling off its trailer.  But it would take more than a traffic jam to stop the South juggernaught today. 
Out of the blocks straightaway, brilliant midfield play from Tim Clapp and Dave Aston on the left and Jack Chalk and Kev on the right caused mayhem to give South a well deserved 2-0 lead after only 20 minutes.  The first came after Kev and Jack had worked the ball down the right channel and the ball eventually found its way to find Rob Barton with time and space in the D.  The second came only moments later when a super Bristowe tackle wrong footed the Peterborough midfield and play was switched back, Graham McCulloch racing through and shrugging off the last man to finish clinically after the perfect  through ball from midfield. 
Having struggled to make much of an impact early on, a stunned City of Peterborough struck back with a goal of their own at the near post and narrowly avoided going 3-1 down after a fine reaction save from a broken down short corner, a perfect cross pitch ball out of defence left South floundering and Ian Evans in goal could do nothing as three Peterborough forwards decided between themselves which one of them could slot in the equaliser. 
Not to be outdone by this, the Monckasaurus, who had already displayed his bulk to perfection at centre back, thumped a 16 yard hit of his own straight through the entire midfield to Rob Barton who made no mistake to give South a 3-2 interval lead. 
Peterborough started the second half stronger and came closest to scoring when a flicked short corner was superbly stopped by Ian Evans thighs and cleared off the line by George and Dave.  Despite Peterborough having much of the ball, clear cut opportunities were limited with Nick Bristowe and Ron Oren immense in defence, and Sanjay showing he wasnt missing his broken headband with some stick trickery in midfield.  But superb interplay between the Peterborough forwards left the South rearguard outnumbered and the equaliser was swept in past the outstretched foot of Ian Evans.
3-3, 10 minutes left, it was then anyones game to win as legs tired. A golden opportunity was spurned when a Peterborough forward found himself with time and space only yards in front of goal, but was smothered out by George and Ian in what seemed like slow motion.  Shortly after that, a ball played right across the face of goal was missed by everyone.
At the other end, Graham McCulloch and Rob Barton combined superbly twice, only to see the ball roll inches wide of the left post, and then the keeper saving point blank when Barton looked destined to score.  Finally, with only 3 minutes left, a melee led to the ball dropping to Rob ""Dog in the D"" Barton and it was he that latched on to the ball as if it was a juicy bone to loft it home as the keeper scrambled to his feet, securing his hat trick and snatching a superb 4-3 victory.","Men's 2nds take all 3 points away at City of Peterborough 6","False","False",,1,"True","False",

Despite having a strong side on paper, things looked bleak at the outset when sweeper Nick Bristowe called in sick, and South's strongest opponent of the season, the A14 traffic, again displayed its true form by holding up keeper Shabhaz Ali on his way from the 3rds match.
However, all 12 players arrived in time for the start of what would be a very scrappy match.   After the initial early exchanges, Spalding took the lead when a move down their left was cut back to be swept past Shabhaz's dive at the near post.   
The opposition goal however sparked South into life.   Chances came and went, including a fine save from the Spalding keeper when faced with a one-on one against Graham McCulloch.   South were finishing the first half the stronger of the two teams, and it was no surprise when South equalised.   A ball was slipped to new signing Ally Ward on the left in the opposition area, who finished with aplomb past the keeper at the near post to put South level at the break.
At half time, captain Dave Aston was preparing himself for a Caesar-like rally of his troops to send them out for the second half.   However, a selfish hurricane ruined this potential life-changing moment, and sent Dave's well-prepared notes scattering across the pitch.   
South re-emerged for the second half hoping to be re-energised by the goal, but it was Spalding who re-started the stronger.   The opposition had a lot of the ball in the South half, but some fine tackling from the defensive four ensured that Spalding were only limited to half chances.   When the opposition did break through South's back line, a fine save from Shabhaz Ali at his near post ensured the scores remained level at 1-1.
Up the other end, as the half progressed, South's forward play and aggression (most notably from Bhav Virdee!) certainly unsettled the opposition.   A few crosses from Bhav and Kev into the opposition D created havoc, and a strong Monckasaurus shot from a short corner was deflected wide by a defensive stick.
Into the last five minutes, and South were still causing problems for the opposition defence.   From a long corner, the ball found its way to Matt the engine Readman on the left hand side of the D.   Matt did the rest.   A fine swept finish into the top right corner sent South ecstatic.   South still needed to hang on for the last 5 minutes, but they defended heroically, and came away with a 2-1 victory.   Once again, all the team worked their socks off to win a very tough match.   This leaves South with 6 points from 2 games, a fantastic start to life in Division 4NW!

South started the game sprightly, something of a minor miracle after captain Dave Aston had planned 24 substitutions in a 70 minute masterplan which would have baffled Einstein himself and confused Sanjay so much that he left the field of play on 8 minutes and 42 seconds assuming he had been subbed.
Despite Dave's best attempts to introduce quantum physics to hockey, South's play and movement was confident and flowing and they looked much the better team for the first quarter of the game. The pace and movement displayed by the midfield in particular showed South had more than made the transition to 4NW. However, as the half progressed, Ely's class showed and they increasingly pressurised South's 25, mostly through their speed and skill in the centre. They were kept out largely by some physical defending, not least from Ron (who displayed his ""chopper"" tendencies), and the left leg of a sprightly Shahbaz who sporting a pair of sexy blue kickers to go with the yellow leg guards to excellent effect. Several short corners were forced and won, one of which as eventually finished off at the near post. To their credit, South pressed forward and equalised almost immediately when Graham McCulloch deftly diverted a ball over the keeper's head.
Level at the break, South looked for an opening early in the second but despite stringing together some good moves, the Ely rearguard snuffed out the danger capably without looking overstretched. At the other end, South's defence manfully kept Ely at bay for 20 minutes, helped in part by the Monckausarus adding a new dimension to his defensive game with a brilliant stick save on the line. Unfortunately only moments later he was penalised for an even better kick save as he tried to stake a claim for keeper for next week. The resulting flick put Ely 2-1 up. Five minutes later, a flowing move saw a clinical third dispatched to Shahbaz's right and the Monckausaurus green carded for giving the umpire harsh words. Shahbaz made several fine saves including one which saw an Ely stick cartwheel through the air, but a 3-1 scoreline reflected the balance of play and the team never stopped running.
This was South's strongest performance of the season against a side who will undoubedly trouble the pack as the season goes on and there were many positive to take away. Except of course for the substitutions and Dave Aston disrespecting the sacred tin for a second week running. Fortunately for Dave (Aston) the other Dave (Monck) took the coveted lemon award in a close vote after forgetting his astros, giving away a flick and arguing with the umpire.

South needed a strong performance right from the off, and they wasted no time in setting about the opposition, with an early cross reaching Bhav Virdee on the right side of the area, but the ball was put just past the post.
Further bright attacks came and went, before Bhav settled any nerves with a sweetly struck shot from a short corner.   The ball came to Bhav on the edge of the D and he wasted no time blasting the ball past the helpless keeper into the goal.   This opener was soon followed by a similarly sweet struck shot from Tristen Knight.   He controlled the ball at the top of the D, wasted a little time winding up his shot, but the goal was certainly worth waiting for, as it whistled past the goalie into the top left hand corner.
South continued to play swift pass and move hockey, opening up the March defence with their pace.   It was no surprise that another goal was scored before half-time, Mr Virdee again being in the right place to steer his shot past the keeper.
3-0 at the break, but South needed to ensure they did not take their foot off the gas.   A string of short corners came March's way early in the second half, but these were well dealt with by the water-tight defence, with new keeper Ben Buckley producing fine saves when called upon.   The keeper also commanded his D well and came out to thwart opposition attacks, and was well deserving of his man of the match award.
Whilst desperate not to concede, South were still keen to add to their tally.   A fine move down the left resulted in the ball being cut back to the top of the opposition area.   A shot from James Cobbe was well saved by the March keeper, but fox-in-any-box George Wych was first to the rebound, driving his first (but not last) goal for South hard against the backboard, a finish Lord Rob Barton OBE himself would have been proud of.   This capped a professional display from the team, who now look forward to a tough (but winnable) match next week away to Rutland, one of the division's early pace-setters.","Men's 2nds beat an underpar March Town by 4 goals.","False","False",,1,"True","False",

South 2nds made the long journey to Rutland more in hope than expectation. There were certainly few portents that the day would finish in a turnaround of similar proportions to that played out by Henry V's army on St Crispin's morning 594 years ago. Indeed the corresponding result last year and Rutland's performance so far this season were reasons for the team perhaps to  feel that they were on a hiding to nothing and their time would be better spent catching up on sleep rather than setting off at 08:30 on a rainy morning. 
However, South are made of stern stuff and fear no-one. Right from the pushback the team unleashed such an irresistible wave of attacks that the Home defence conceded 2 goals in the first 10 minutes. 
First up was a splendid move down the right by Bhav Virdee and Kev Rowland which set up Jack Chalk to drive into the D and win a short corner. Everybody  was set up for the pre-planned first routine (a short injection by Graham McCulloch to Manu Bhardwaj for a drag-flick). Everybody except Graham that is who went off-script and pushed out to Jack at the top of the D. Caught by surprise, surely Jack would find himself in trouble? Nothing of the sort. No panic, Jack calmly dribbled around the onrushing runners and slotted the ball past the keeper's left into the bottom corner.
One-nil, but wouldn't that just force Rutland to raise their game? Who cares? South simply moved up a few gears themselves and swept up the left hand side this time. A move started by the irrepressible Nick Bristowe was continued with interplay between Dave Aston and Tim Clapp that would not look out of place in Div 3 and a second short corner was won. This time a classic Route 1 routine was executed flawlessly and Nick drilled a fierce shot into right of the goal to score his first goal for South.
Two-nil! But there was still an hour to go and now finally Rutland realised that there was a game to be played. The Home team pushed forward relentlessly and forced a series of short corners. The first five or six were all charged down by George Wych and then cleared by the defence 5 but finally one got through and, after a melee around Shabhaz Ali's pads, the ball rolled towards the goal where the Umpire spotted an infringement and signalled a flick which was put away confidently by the Rutland centre-forward.
Into the second half now and, despite playing into the rain, once again it was South  who started the brighter with the midfield and forwards forcing Rutland into a number of simple mistakes to concede possession. Great work from both Rob Barton and Graham piled on the pressure and won South their third short of the match. Surely we couldn't make it 3 out of 3? You bet we could! This time Graham read the script and pushed out to Manu who placed a beautiful drag flick into the goal between keeper and defender. 
With a 2 goal cushion restored South could begin to dream the impossible dream but Rutland had other plans. Once again spurred on by their impressive Number 10 the Home team began to dominate possession and time and again made headway into the South 25, only to break against unwavering resistance from Nick, Manu and Ron Oren. The few times that they did break through, the attacks were comprehensively snuffed out by Shahbaz. However, something had to give and South again conceded a string of short corners which (also again) were cleared out by the defence but finally one shot got through and rolled into the goal to make it 3-2.
With everything to play for Rutland now pressed forward yet more, calling for heroics from all the team but then the unthinkable happened - yet another attack seemed to have been dealt with but the other Umpire this time signalled for Rutland's second penalty flick of the match. It looked to be a matter of so near and yet so far for South and that a point was all they could hope for. However, cometh the hour, cometh the man - and that man was Shahbaz, making a fantastic stick save against the well-taken flick to keep that precious 1 goal lead. 
Even then, the game was not over and skipper Dave Aston had to rally the team to concentrate against further advances, one of which provided a contender for Miss of the Season as a Rutland attacker contrived completely to miss a ball rolling invitingly across an open goal. South themselves were also often on the front foot, with most attacks featuring the evergreen Kev despite his injuries (see below) but it was Rutland who were to have the last significant play of the day. With less than a minute on the clock, the home team won a final short corner and brought all their outfield players up in search of the equaliser. Squeaky-bum time for South's travelling support (who am I kidding?) but there was nothing to fear as the defence imperiously snuffed out any threat and swept the ball upfield for the midfield to hold it until the final whistle and scenes of delirious joy. 
No battle would be complete without injuries and this match was certainly no exception Tim Clapp (head), Kev (head), Manu (chest) and Dave A (knees) merit mentions in dispatches but there were not many of the team who left the field without at least one bruise to treat.
After the game Captain Dave Aston said: 
<em>This story shall the good man teach his son; <br />And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by, <br />From this day to the ending of the world, <br />But we in it shall be remember'd; <br />We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; <br />For he to-day that sheds his blood with me <br />Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile, <br />This day shall gentle his condition: <br />And gentlemen in England now a-bed <br />Shall think themselves accursed they were not here, <br />And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks <br />That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.<br /></em>
(or something like that)
What an epic match! And that's without even giving mention to numerous wrong turnings in the journey, Rob Barton's lecture on the properties of old treacle, Bhav overcoming his never-nude paranoia, the cold showers, Graham's trousers magically shrinking and Kev's catwalk routine. Well, some things are best left to the imagination!

City's first trick on this Halloween day was to turn up with only 9 players.   Most teams would consider this a treat, but South did not, playing the opening 20 minutes in a somewhat sluggish manner and failing to make their two man advantage count.
However, after the two final players did turn up, South seemed to suddenly spring into action.   A number of half chances came and went, before Rob Barton took the game by the scruff of the neck, neatly nutmegging his marker before sending an unstoppable shot into the bottom corner of the goal.   This lead to further positive play until half-time, especially down the right from Bhav Virdee and Rich Morgan, but no further rewards arrived.
South re-appeared after the break somewhat aggrieved they had not made their two-man advantage tell, and wasted little time before doubling their lead.   Manu Bhardwaj proved that his eye-of-a-needle short corner goal the week before was no fluke, threading another flick into the bottom corner just inside the near post.
Two quick goals then followed, both from Graham.   The first was a lovely deflection of a left wing cross into the far corner, and the second was a crisp finish after being put through one on one by an incisve pass by Rob Barton.   South were now comfortable early in the second half, but a few lapses of concentration let City back into the game.   Firstly, the enemy nicked a goal after a goalmouth scramble, and then a second goal ensued following some fine work down the left.
However, South regained their concentration, and despite City winning a number of short corners, South saw out the game relatively comfortably, with the help of some good saves again from Shabhaz Ali.   Graham McCulloch also struck the post from close range following another expertly worked short corner.   South now sit joint top of the table on 15 points, but face a potentially difficult match again next week away against Wisbech, another one of last year's promoted sides who have had no trouble adjusting to life at a higher level.","Men's 2nds win a local derby against Cambridge City 5","False","False",,1,"True","False",

For the first 15 minutes, South had much the better of play and were unlucky not to take the lead when debutant John Hawkes beat the keeper from a narrow angle only to find his well struck shot flash inches wide.  A few minutes later, a Bristowe short corner strike ballooned off the keeper's kicker and McCulloch was in the right place to slam the ball home as it dropped out of the night sky.
Unfortunately taking the lead angered the Fenlanders who proceeded to find three goals of their own. Wisbech's swift movement and accurate passing caused problems throughout and hurried South into several errors.  Goalkeeper Buckley was forced on several occasions to lead the charge out to the edge of the D but could do little about any of the goals, all of which were close range strikes, one of which was from a melee after a short corner had been half stopped.
In past seasons, heads would have dropped, but instead Captain Aston, who had earlier claimed he might have had Swine Flu, rallied the troops at half-time and the second half, a rejuvenated South appeared and waves of Fenny attacks were kept at bay largely by the South backline sticking to the task well and by Jack Chalk keeping a close eye on the speedy Wisbech midfielder who had caused havoc in the first half.  The Monckausarus, once again, sought to make his presence felt.  His victim was later seen with his arm in a sling in the club house.
But, largely aided by a very capable Wisbech sweeper, and on a day where South simply didn't get the rub of the green, South found it difficult to fashion any clear cut opportunities of their own.  The best chance of the second half fell to John Hawkes again, who was inches away from connecting with a ball at the far post.  Man of the Match Ian Glover put in a particularly impressive performance at right back and constantly asked questions when he pressed forward, despite only been called up at the last minute  As the misty night drew on, there was still time for Buckley to try and impress the judges with some celebrity come dancing style footwork which almost presented a Wisbech forward with an opportunity for a 4th, and for a Wisbech forward to almost put the ball out of the cage and into the Wash with a wayward strike.After the game Captain Aston praised the team of digging deep in the second half against a team clearly much stronger than the Wisbech IIIs team which had snatched a 1-0 win in the same fixture last year.Amazingly, this week's Lemon award went to Kev Rowland, presumably for not playing at all.

And in fairly blustery conditions, South duly obliged by brushing aside a Bourne side and playing some excellent hockey all round from front to back.
With Ron ""Chopper"" Oren on 1st team duty, and the Monckosaurus unavailable, concerns had been raised at the possible lack of ""bulk"" and ""aggression"" in the defence.  Those were dispelled within minutes when a Wicked Wych clearance thundered into a Bourne shinpad, forcing them down to 10 men for several minutes, and Kaptain Kev put in a crunching tackle to cut down a Bourne move in its prime.
Having signalled these signs of intent, South turned rear domination into expansive midfield dynamism and forward play throughout the first half.  The Bourne keeper was forced into several saves, including a palm save from a Rob Barton reverse stick shot (would we expect anything else) after George Wych did a Shergar and disappeared from Right Back only to appear galloping up the right wing and dispatching a majestic ball into the D.  Another direct strike from a Bristowe at a short corner was dispatched over the bar by the keeper's toe.  Moments later South finally did beat the keeper after Bav had hurried and hassled down the right and had played the ball into a crowded D only to find that a short corner had been awarded in the melee for the goalkeeper sitting on the ball. 
However South stuck to the task and eventually the Bourne backline was breached when a superb through ball found John Harkes clear in the 25 who then marched into the D to slot home for a cool finish, his first for South.  
A 1-0 scoreline hardly reflected the domination south enjoyed in the first 35 minutes. 
Bourne showed more enthusiasm and ambition in the second half to press forward, but were met with Leo Tomita and Nick Bristowe in fine form, and Captain Dave Aston holding his own at left back.  This more than snuffed out any threats on the South D by the canny Bourne midfielders who clearly knew how to wield a stick.  Jack Chalk kept one of them well and truly occupied.
However it didn't take long for South to open up more opportunities.  The midfield duo of Harkes and Clapp found were continually hassling and completely overran their counterparts.  A superb flowing move, the best of the game, involving the entire midfield combination of Clapp/Chalk/Virdee/Harkes presented a golden opportunity at the right post which went begging.  Former Kaptain Kev's view of the situation that Mary Poppins herself would have scored with her umbrella.  
Thankfully at the other end, South were not being so generous.  The only clear cut opportunity came as rain threatened and a short was awarded in the gloom when a defender had trod on the ball.  The ensuing shot failed to trouble Ben Buckley who admitted after the game that he in fact fell over as the shot was taken and ended the game having failed to touch the ball at all.  
However, after that little indiscretion, it wasn't long before South were back in business and with 10 minutes remaining, Ali Ward raced onto a pin point ball to slot in number two, with Bav chasing on in the hope he might snaffle the goal himself.  At 2-0, South looked far more composed on the ball and soon afterwards a flick was duly converted by Jack Chalk to round of proceedings with a third.  Had the game continued in that vein, the scoreline would have expanded.  Although having said that, had Jack informed the rest of the team that he had in fact missed this last three flicks, he perhaps would not have found himself clothed with the honour of taking one.
As usual, South commitment to the cause was more than displayed through its fair share of bravery in the face of the enemy with Ali Ward (ankle) and Kev (shin) gracefully plummeting to the ground, and John Harkes impressively bleeding over the Leys pitch from various limbs.  Certain others who shall remain nameless, fell to the earth with much less dignity when faced with the autumn leaves.
So with Rutland defeating Ely 3-2, South leapfrogged Ely into 3rd place in 4NW, their highest position since records began, or at least electronically anyhow, a position occupied by the 1st team four seasons ago, and a position well befitting a side dominant against a side relegated from 3NW last year.
On a day when South kept their second clean sheet of the campaign, goalkeeper Ben Buckley (who was responsible for the last clean sheet against March) went from hero to zero and was deemed lemonesque.  Presumably on the basis that he could and probably should have put his feet up at home instead of getting himself, and the goalkeeping kit, soaking wet.  Probably the most ridiculous decision since Lino was awarded man of the match last season in an 11-0 win...","Men's 2nds play well and take all 3 points against Bourne","False","False",,1,"True","False",

South started the game not too bad, but soon Long Sutton were putting pressure on the new defensive backline- particularly down the right wing with a very nippy fifteen year old who was later to meet his match!
Sutton attacked with pace down the wing, but despite having some promising openings- they rarely threatened the goal.  Ben Buckley was called into action on one occasion however, where a smart save at his post and a quick clearance prevented Long Sutton going in ahead at the break.   Up the other end, South's main opportunity came from a short corner, but a shot from Nick Bristowe was snuffed out by the home defence.
After the break, South came out all guns blazing and really set about their opposition.   With Bhav Virdee now on the left keeping the opposition no.17 quiet, new signing Rob Leigh was able to show his attacking promise down the right, and interlinked well with John Hawkes and the attackers.   Graham McCulloch went close with a shot from the top of the D, and South also had a great short corner opportunity stopped by the home defence.   Meanwhile, the home team got slightly more physical, and whilst South stood tough in the face of this new approach, Bhav Virdee was perhaps slightly unlucky to be carded for a strong challenge in midfield.
Despite being down to 10 men, South continued to press with Rob and Graham both creating good opportunities.   However, South were unable to convert these, and as the match reached the final minute, Sutton were awarded (some claim wrongly!) a final short corner.  Led out by the marauding George Wych, South ensured there was to be no final sting in the tail, and cleared the corner to ensure the game finished nil nil.
South should be proud of the performance although a little disappointed with the result, as their fine second half performance probably merited more than a single point.   South will hope to get back to winning ways at home next week against St Neots. 
(ED's Note: On a day when Horncastle put 19 past St Neots and Rutland scored 11 against March, both without reply, maybe the spectators at our match could be forgiven for wishing they were somewhere else - thanks for staying awake Lino!)","Men's 2nds grind out a rare 0-0 draw at Long Sutton","False","False",,1,"True","False",

A goal no doubt that Lord R Barton Esq. will recount to the granchildren in years to come, and being all the more remarkable for being a front stick shot.  A second followed shortly after when Chris Gravelling lifted the ball over the keeper who had saved the initial shot from a short corner.  Dave Aston then added a third following a mazy run from midfield in a selfish piece of showponying (or a wonderful piece of individual skill depending on how you look at it).  Tim Clapp then notched the fourth from a narrow angle, only seconds after coming on as a substitute.Whilst a 4-0 half time score suggested complete domination, in fact the half was remarkably even with Chris Gravelling marshalling an unfamiliar but busy defence of Ian Glover, Manu Bharwaj and Dave Aston.  St Neots fashioned more than enough openings to claw their way back in the game. The fact that they did not was largely down to Shahbaz who was in formidable form.  He pulled off two crucial saves with the score 2-0, both when St. Neots players had broken free of the ranks, and then a 3rd at 3-0 when he stole the ball with his stick on the edge of the D to find Ian Glover at left back.  A move which then led to the 4th goal.The second half followed much the same tale.  For all of their possession, St Neots were not able to meet their confident build up play with the exacting finish which was required to beat the South rearguard, and when Shahbaz was finally beaten, Chris Graveling lunged majestically to clear the ball off the line.  However by that stage, South were already 7-0 up thanks in no small measure by man of the match Tim Clapp, who was exceptional all game.  He had chased a lost cause to cross and set up Rob Barton for his second and latched on to a through ball to completed his own brace.  Manu added another to his trademark collection of dragged short corners and to conclude a miserable day for St Neots, Jack Chalk notched his second flick in as many home games after a defender, very harshly, was deemed to have deliberately fouled Dave Aston in the D.In the midst of the goalscoring, Rupert Espley put in a dogged performance following his call up from the 3s and both he and Ally Ward were unlucky to find shots drag agonisingly wide.  Chris Graveling also forced a point blank save from the keeper.  Bav took this week's injury award by getting himself in the way of a lifted clearance and Kardinal Kev, as usual, found himself in the wars and departed the pitch at full time with two bloody knees, a knock after colliding with his midfield counterpart and a wet arse after falling over twice.  Whilst 8-0 was undoubtedly harsh on a St Neots side who had otherwise had their fair share of possession, the difference between the two sides was unquestionably the ruthlessness with which South took their opportunities, and the first rate defence and goalkeeping which meant South recorded their third successive clean sheet.After the game, Lino was branded this week's fruit of the citrus grove in controversial circumstances.  Two votes were ""rigged"" by members of the team who took advantage of Lino leaving proceedings to negotiate a reduction on the terrible post-match sandwiches at the Bar.  Calls for a re-count based on spoilt ballot papers under the Representation of the People Act 1983 fell on deaf ears.  Thanks for that.  Next time guys you can make your own *******g sandwiches...","Men's 2nds claim a straightforward 3 points against St Neots","False","False",,1,"True","False",
111,"05/12/2009","League",2,53,"12:30:00",38,"Away","0","5","0","4","False","False","False","<p>There is a Taoist saying that &ldquo;the journey is the reward&rdquo; and Cambridge South 2nd XI can, I am sure, take great comfort from this after a 4 hour round trip yielded only a 5-0 drubbing at the hands of a well-drilled Horncastle side.</p>
<p>South were forced to field a much weakened team as holiday, requirements from the 1s and a general lack of Taoist spirit meant that they had available only 6 of their regular squad and just 11 men in total. That&nbsp;they could play at all was down to the selfless commitment of Shahbaz Ali, Andy Passmore, Ian Glover and Simon Jelley all of whom stepped up from their regular teams to make it happen - thanks guys. Thanks also are due to Lino who, although unfit to play and with a train to catch, drove all that way just to umpire.</p>
<p>Horncastle are top of the Division, having a 100% record this season with 64 goals scored in 9 matches so South knew that they would have to play their very best just to stay in the game and unfortunately in the first half this did not happen. Understandably, given the weakened team, South were under the cosh right from the start as the home team pressed forward confidently. With only about 5 minutes on the clock they won a short corner and a great routine (clearly well practised) saw a fast and accurate push out, a fast and accurate flick to the far post and a fast and accurate runner on hand to lift the ball over Shahbaz and into the goal.</p>
<p>To their credit, South did not let this setback upset their discipline and the defence were managing creditably against the best attack in the League. George Wych marked the opposition's top scorer out of the game whilst Andy Passmore and Ian Glover broke down anything coming down the wings. Jack Chalk, playing out of position in a sweeper's role, was dominant and always on hand to mop up anything else that got through. However South were on the back foot and further goals were inevitable. Three more came in quick succession - one from another very good short corner - and it looked at this point as if a cricket score might be on the cards.</p>
<p>The team needed to stem the flow of attacks and in the second quarter this did begin to happen. Dave Aston and Kev Rowland in central midfield positions covered some impressive yardage to help out in defence but still Horncastle remained on top and thought they had scored a fifth goal when a wicked lifting shot from an acute angle appeared to have beaten Shahbaz. However, closer inspection revealed a small hole in the side netting and South disputed the goal. The umpires consulted and, much to the disgust of the Home side, awarded a 16 yard hit. This was certainly the correct decision from the umpires as both were unsighted and not able to say for sure that it was a goal.</p>
<p>So 4-0 down at half time and South were into damage limitation. Skipper Dave Aston ordered a tactical re-jig in midfield, switching to a 4-4-1-1 formation to bolster the defence and following this the second period was more even. Horncastle scored a 5th from another short corner but apart from that there were few scares and South's midfield saw a lot more of the ball - in particular Simon Jelley stepped up to play some great linking play up the left with Rob Barton and Bhav Virdi was competitive as ever. One such move led to Bhav accidentally injuring a Horncastle player when the ball flicked up off his stick into the player's face. Not content with simply injuring the man, Bhav started to remonstrate with him as well only to get an earful from the player's mother from the sideline with the immortal words &ldquo;Leave him alone, he's not a violent boy, he's my little boy&rdquo; (her &ldquo;little boy&rdquo; was a grown man and, if there is any justice in the world, will take some stick for this for the rest of his playing career).</p>
<p>South continued to press forward manfully in search of a goal and there were several occasions where Rob Barton and John Hawkes forced half chances but in truth it is a measure of the balance of the game that South did not have a single shot on goal all match.</p>
<p>All in all perhaps a day to forget. If only that were possible. Those of us privileged enough to travel to the game with Dave Aston are still having flashbacks to the moment when Dave, perhaps having&nbsp;in mind the quotation from Virginibus Puerisque that &ldquo;to travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive&rdquo;, pulled out to overtake a beet lorry right into the face of an oncoming juggernaught. Kev, uttering a cry like a man passing a kidney stone saw his whole life (and that's a long time) flash before his eyes; George and John closed their eyes and hoped for the best. Time seemed to stand still as the Rover, engine screaming in an unfeasibly low gear, used all of its 1,200ccs to reach safety by a hair's breadth. NEVER doubt the Rover!

In the absence of Dave Aston, Dave Monck donned the captain's armband (or rather he would have done if we could find it) and marshalled the troops in suitably pre-historic fashion. Rumour had it that the Monckausaurus was considering asking if the entire team could play dressed as cavemen and with clubs instead of sticks until the green shirts arrived and a more conservative dress theme was adopted.
Rather than being a cracker, the game was rather like the pair of socks from the great aunt you rip open in the vain hope that a 20 note might be stuffed inside.
After an uneventful and goalless 20 minutes, South took the lead from their first short corner with Nick Bristowe applying the finish via a defender's stick to spin over the line. South then doubled that lead when man of the match Rob Leigh found himself with time and space and lobbed an inch perfect pass over a defender's stick to the waiting Rob Barton to do the rest. Rob Leigh and Ali Ward's high work rates were influential all game as they tore into the opposition like a Jack Russell attached to a postman's trouser leg and the midfield of Kardinal Kev, Bhav and Jack Chalk once again formed an impenetrable Christmas Pudding through the middle.
At 2-0 South looked comfortable but without really threatening to nail the coffin completely shut against a side which fashioned little in the way of chances. Perhaps it was the prospect of the Roast Turkey and trimmings awaiting in less than a fortnight's time that meant mid-way through the second half Peterborough threatened a revival by converting their own short corner after a gift wrapped opportunity was presented at Ben Buckley's left hand post, leaving the keeper feeling like Santa Clause reprimanding his elves. The defence of Manu, George, the Monckausaurus, Nick and JB were not otherwise overworked, and presumably were spurred on by the fragrant smell of Santa's newly washed shorts.
Normality was resumed shortly afterwards when The Right Reverend Kardinal Kevin Rowland blasted home a short corner into the middle of the backboard after a Peterborough defender had earlier got himself in the way of a rising shot.
By this time, Dave Aston had decided that audit work in USA was far less important that South's final fixture of 2009 and promptly appeared for a gallant second half cameo. Sadly for him, he was denied his moment of glory when he was thwarted by none other than Rob ""Christmas Turkey"" Barton, sporting a new silver fox haircut. He had decided that Dave had no right to turn up late and beat the keeper and the final defender with an exquisite shot, so Rob lifted a ball rolling into the empty net on to the post instead. The rest of the team had already at that point resumed their positions for push-back and both umpires were getting their notebooks out to signal a 4th goal. There were reports after the game that Lord Barton of Chesterton was seen collecting a bag full of old 5 notes from an unnamed betting consortium in the Leys Car Park. He made a quick exit and the first ever unanimous lemon award was granted in his absence.
So, 3-1 it finished and with Ely's win in Long Sutton, South end 2009 in 5th place in 4NW.

However it was Ely who started the sharper in the first half, with some impressive breaks down the left and right flanks.   South's defence were severely tested, but the back four of Monckasaurus, Manu Bhardwaj, George Wych and Matt Readman (who produced a fine individual display despite coming up against stronger than usual opposition) held firm, with Monckasaurus and Matt in particular producing some fine last ditch tackles when called upon.   When Ely did penetrate the South defence, Ben Buckley made some fine saves when called upon- a point blank save at his left hand post being particularly memorable.
Although they were perhaps lucky to go in goalless at the break, South re-started the match determined to put in a strong second half performance.   The midfield and attack started to cause Ely problems with quick snappy intelligent passing.   Goal poacher extraordinaire Rob Barton deflected a Bav Virdee cross just past the post, and a growling short corner thump from The Monckasaurus was deflected by an Ely foot just past the post.   Rob Leigh and Tim Clapp were also causing problems to the Ely defence, and South more than equal to their opposition.
It looked though like this effort could almost be in vain, as at the death Ely won a final short corner.   However, a last ditch swipe off the line from the Monckasaurus (aided by Manu Bhadwaj's kicking foot) ensure the game finished nil-nil.   Favourable results elsewhere at the top of 4NW means that South are still in the promotion hunt, but the next two matches now take on an added importance.","Men's 2nds drew 0-0 with Ely City 2","False","False",,1,"True","False",

Lino and Dave A had worked wonders to pull together a good team after the usual squad had been plundered by the 1s who called up 4 players for their Away match. Offsetting this however, was the arrival of the new team shirts (guaranteed to put a spring in our stride) together with Rutland turning up late and having to start the match with only 9 players.</p>
<p>So, resplendent in emerald green South started off in fine spirit and the pattern of the game was set from the push-back. Although South's play was patchy, when the team actually passed the ball and moved into space the Rutland defence were always under pressure. From the other side, the Rutland team clearly had a number of very skilled individual players but could not string together any team play to create chances. On the left of defence Ian Glover was more than a match for his opponent and in the centre Dave Monck (despite being tired after only 5 minutes of the game) was rarely troubled. The pairing of Nick Bristowe (sweeper) and Eliot Read (back of the diamond) worked supremely well to snuff out the Rutland playmakers in midfield and on the few occasions that Rutland were able to fashion an opening goalkeeper Ben Buckley pulled off some fantastic saves to shut them out.</p>
<p>South took advantage of their numerical superiority in the early stages, pushing forward with good moves up the right by George Wych and Kev Rowland supported well by Jack Chalk in the centre. One such move led to a short corner which, although the initial strike was blocked, found its way to Rob Barton to take a classic reverse stick goal.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, the remaining Rutland players arrived but South continued to have most of the chances and Rob was able to complete a fantastic hat-trick before half time. His second was a sharp effort, ghosting in behind the defence to deflect in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Tim Clapp cross&nbsp;and a few minutes later a howler from the Rutland defender who elected to self-pass on a 16 yard hit allowed him to nick the ball and&nbsp;apply a&nbsp;slide-rule finish to&nbsp;make it 3-0.</p>
<p>So South turned around with a good lead and surely captain Dave Aston would be delighted with this? Not a bit of it. Displaying a character trait that must concern his girlfriend, the more he was on top, the angrier Dave got - resulting in several tirades against surprised team-mates and reducing some of us almost to tears! Don't worry Dave, we know it's just because you care!</p>

<p>The game now entered a decisive phase. Rutland were not going to give up without a fight and pressed forward to win a series of short corners, one of which they converted with a strike deflected in by the man running in on the post. At this point, despite a 2 goal lead, the game could have gone either way. The next goal was very important and it went to South. Channelling his anger into creative hockey, Dave A made a great break up the left, bursting into the D and forcing another short corner. A crisp push-out from Tim Clapp was equally crisply converted by Nick to make it 4-1 and put the game beyond reach of the away side. The remainder of the match was largely played out in the Rutland half and in the final few minutes John Hawkes rounded off a great performance by scoring South's 5th goal, sliding in on his knees to chip a pass from Rob over the keeper's outstretched pads.The result puts South equal 3rd in Div 4 (5th on goal difference) and promotion still within reach, albeit requiring other results to go our way.</p>","Men's 2nds beat Rutland 5 goals to 1","False","False",,1,"True","False",

The first half was a tense affair, with South unable to break through the home defence despite having a number of short corners.   Up the other end, the defensive back four of Bristowe, Tomita, Aston and Glover rebuffed any City attacks when they arrived, and Ben Buckley was completely untested in the South goal.   Tomita and Bristowe were doing their best to start free-flowing attacking moves from deep, but it seemed South were lacking a cutting edge in the final third.
After a goalless first half, South re-emerged after the break determined to translate their superior possession into goals.   Nick Bristowe went close twice, once from a short corner where the keeper stood up to his shot, and then a drive from the edge of the D in open play was tipped expertly round the post.   Goal king Rob Barton also saw a reverse stick special smothered by the keeper.
South were not to be denied however, and Lord Barton struck clinically into the corner with his trademark reverse sweep to give them a merited lead.   Refusing to sit on their lead, South then doubled their advantage midway through the second half, when a sumptuous team move finished with a perfect cross from Kev Rowland being tucked away first time with aplomb by Barton to effectively seal the game.   Further short corner attempts were snuffled out by the City keeper, before they had a chance of their own from a short corner to gain a consolation goal at the death.   Whilst the first attempt was put behind by Ian Glover, City were not to be denied, as they capitalised on some slower than usual running out by George Wych (!) to deflect a low shot into the roof of the net. This was to be the last action of the game, and South march on to a crucial promotion match next week at home to Wisbech.","Men's 2nds win the local derby against Cambridge City 5","False","False",,1,"True","False",

Despite the aforementioned monumental team talk from Captain Dave, it was Wisbech who began the first half by far the stronger, with their youthful side showing a good passing game to put the South defence under pressure.   Whilst having the lion's share of possession, they had little to show for it in terms of opportunities on goal, as the South defence held firm.   Short corner attempts were rebuffed by the returning George Wych, whose running out was once again exemplary.   
As the half wore on, South began to exert a much stronger foothold in the game, with the midfield quartet linking up well with the strike partnership of Tim and Joey Barton.   Two well weighted passes from Tim slipped in Rob Leigh for one on ones with the Wisbech keeper, but the opposition no.1 was equal to it, advancing quickly off his line to quickly rebuff the chance.   A short corner attempt was cunningly diverted wide by a Wisbech defensive foot when it looked destined to be a goal but the half ended goalless.
After the interval, South re-emerged determined to continue where they had left off at the end of the first half.   However, Wisbech were building some fine attacks of their own, with a number of short corners being well dealt with by the home defence.   A further Wisbech attack led to another short corner.   This time, despite the attempts of the home defence, the corner was superbly struck into the bottom left hand corner of Shabhaz's goal, and South found themselves a goal down.
The team refused to be deterred however, and South pressed forwards in a desperate search of an equaliser.   The game became more and more stretched as a result as more midfielders committed to the attacks, but the home defence stood firm.   Following a further South attack, a short corner was awarded to the home side, much to the dismay of Wisbech.   Kev Rowland's initital effort was well blocked by the opposition defence but the ball came out to Nick just outside the D, who skilfully dribbled into the opposition area before clinically despatching a shot to the keeper's right.   South were ecstatic, and with this new lease of life sought out what could be a crucial winning goal.   A last ditch interception from Wisbech prevented Tim being put through one on one with the keeper.   A final short corner was awarded to Wisbech in the final minute, but again this was rebuffed by the home defence, and a difficult match ended in a draw.
Following this result, Wisbech remain in a strong position to take 2nd spot, but South will continue to look to capitalise on any potential slip-ups from those in front of them in the race for promotion.   Saturday's draw means that only Horncastle (P16W16) have the potential to do the double over South this season, which is a great reflection on the team's success in adjusting to life in a higher division.   All the squad should be congratulated on a great effort so far this term and they should look to continue this away to Bourne next weekend.","Men's 2nds get a point against Wisbech Town 3 ","False","False",,1,"True","False",

Cambridge South 2's set off [slightly/stupidly/insanely*] (*delete as appropriate) early to make the quick trip up the A14 (including through both junction 23 and junction 24) for their away match with Bourne.  An early arrival time was very generous of captain Dave and vice-captain Lino, as arriving simply 45 minutes before the match start does not allow enough time for players to become mentally focused for the match ahead.   If anything, an hour is too short
South got stuck in from the off, some more than others.  Unfortunately Jack Chalk was bloody-chinned by a member of the Bourne opposition, resulting in him having to leave the field after only a few minutes of play.   Lino promptly rushed Jack and the tin of temptation off to A & E, as further minutes on the pitch may aggravate the situation for both of them.
However, this early loss of personnel failed to put South out of their stride.   The back four of Monck, Bristowe, Bhardwaj and Glover were looking extremely calm on the ball, and were starting a number of menacing South attacks.   One such chance led to the opening goal- a fine free hit (from outside the 25) being driven in by Nick Bristowe, and while the Bourne defence stood motionless, Tim Clapp calmly slotted the ball under the keeper to give South the lead.
Keen to turn their attacking advantage into goals, South poured forward for the remainder of the half.   Bourne were looking dangerous when coming forward as the game was already becoming stretched, but strong defensive play from the back 4 ensured that Shahbaz was rarely troubled- although a Bourne shot from the top of the D did strike the outside of the post.
It was no surprise when South scored their second- John Hawkes picked the ball up in midfield and drove menacingly towards the goal.   Once in the area, an unstoppable shot was place into the right corner, and South were two up.   The midfield and strikers were linking up very effectively, and in truth South could have been more up at the break- a flick from Bhardwaj being the closest they came to a goal.
Following half time, South were keen to put the game to bed.   Nick Bristowe was looking dangerous behind the midfield, and pushed forward for a long corner.   The ball was struck to Nick who picked it up on the 25 and drove forwards to send another powerful shot into the corner past the keeper.
South were not done though.   Every attack looked menacing, and it was perhaps no surprise when a cross from the right found Ali Ward, and he calmly slotted the fourth past the keeper's left, to seal a very impressive victory.   The (further) icing on the cake was there for Dave A to take when a great ball from Bav put him one-on-one with the keeper.   Dave however, mindful of the fact that Dave M's aforementioned book was a little short on content, declined the opportunity to score past the keeper, preferring instead to flatten him with his muscular physique in order to win a final short corner.(which unfortunately was not converted).
All-in-all, another very impressive performance from the 2's, which keeps them high in the table, ahead of their double header of matches against Long Sutton and March next weekend.","Men's 2nds beat Bourne 2","False","False",,1,"True","False",

South turned up in body if not in spirit to a mercifully late pushback against Long Sutton with more than half the squad nursing a Bristowe-induced hangover. John (Did I get with a bloke last night? It had short hair and was called Mitch) Hawkes, Kev (chunder in the bath) Rowland, George (hockey on Selwyn lawn) Wych, Dave (I've had him up the arse) Monck, Robbie (pissed on a mate and got punched) Leigh, Dave (didn't chunder - how?) Aston, Ben (I play hockey to improve my stamina) Buckley, Manu (how low can you go) Bhardwaj, Jack (the kids find my goatee cool) Chalk and Nick (no mates at Selwyn) Bristowe all looked a bit green round the gills and, if this were not enough, Bhav Virdee tried to take out one of the only sober team members before the pushback when he undercut a vicious shot into what cricket commentators sometimes call the inner thigh of Rob Barton during the warm-up.
The match started in glorious sunshine and South straight away found plenty of space to run into but for the first 10 minutes the slow Abbey pitch induced a number of mistakes, occasionally allowing Sutton to break from midfield. The defence, marshalled by Chris Graveling and Nick Bristowe, held firm but during one such attack Bhav Virdi (another of the few sober members) took a very painful blow to the knee and was sidelined for the rest of the game. At this point however, South realised that Sutton were playing with only 10 men which explained the amount of space being conceded and now the home team began to press forward with superb runs being made from deep by Manu Bhardwaj and George Wych to support the front players.
And then ... disaster ... South conceded an extraordinarily soft goal on about 20 minutes by allowing a Sutton attacker to shoot from just inside the D. The shot was a mishit and the ball rolled gently towards keeper Ben Buckley who we suspect was seeing double and kicked the wrong ball! In any event the ball finally made it over the goalline and the 10 men of Sutton were 1-0 up.
With the lead, the away side shut up shop and pulled all their players bar one into defensive roles. South were dominant in midfield; Dave Aston and Kev Rowland spread the play wide down the flanks and the centre pairing of John Hawkes and Jack Chalk bossed the middle of the pitch. South were continually on the attack but the Sutton defence was holding firm and only rarely did Rob Barton or Robbie Leigh get a clear chance on goal.
After half time the game continued in the same fashion, with South sending wave after wave of attacks forward, only to see them break on a resolute Sutton defence. On the occasions when South did test the young keeper he responded admirably and the game took an air of inevitability as the clock ran down. To their credit South never stopped running but, despite playing against 10 men for the whole game, could not force the ball into the goal and at the final whistle, the Away team had hung onto their lead and took away a hard-earned 3 points.","Men's 2nds lose to 10 man Long Sutton","False","False",,1,"True","False",
123,"13/03/2010","League",2,124,"12:00",37,"Away","2","1","2","0","False","False","False","After last weekend's disappointments South 2nd XI travelled to St Neots keen to get back to winning ways. Things did not start well as problems on the A14 led to a huge traffic jam on the A428 and the team all arrived 15 minutes late for the pushback so it was straight onto the pitch and into play. Fortunately even this delay was not enough for St Neots and the home side started the game with only 10 players for the first few minutes.
South took full advantage of this and moved the ball about well from the off. The wide midfielders, Kev Rowland and Bhav Virdi were given ample space to exploit the channels and early pressure was rewarded after only 5 minutes when a superb cross in from the left by Dave Aston was expertly touched in by Ali Ward, darting in behind his marker on the right hand post. 
If that was a good goal it was followed only a few minutes later by an equally great finish. Ali this time was the provider, receiving the ball from Dave Aston at the top of the D, turning and then putting in a great flick to the top right hand corner which was parried out by the St Neots keeper but only as far as Rob Barton lurking a few metres out who was able to turn it back just inside the post.
At two nil things were looking good and South could relax and play some expansive hockey. However St Neots had other ideas and over the rest of the first half they dragged themselves back into the match, stretching play and making a number of breaks through the middle to connect up with their 2 strikers. The central defence of Nick Bristowe and Dave Monck held firm and the only scares for South (not counting the threat from one player to Nick that he would get his throat slit) were a number of short corners won by St Neots but the few efforts not charged down by George Wych were mopped up by keeper Ben Buckley who had another exemplary game.
The half time talk was all about passing the ball out to the flanks, making use of the available space and not trying to run single-handedly through the whole defence. This is still an area where South need to improve, especially in the final third of the pitch, and there is no doubt that, with a little more emphasis on the pass-and-move game, South's superior skills and energy could have put the game to bed. However, it was St Neots who upped their game early in the second half and pressed forward with urgency. A number of short corners were forced in quick succession and eventually a good strike found its way into the goal.
For a period now it was all hands to the pump with the defence under the cosh but South withstood the pressure and built a number of attacks themselves; Manu Bhardwaj in particular linked up well with the evergreen Kev who once again was full of running right through the match and up front Rob and Ali forced some good saves from the home keeper. At times it was real end-to-end counter attacking hockey with chances coming and going for both side but South held onto their one goal lead and fully deserved the 3 points albeit that they had made it unnecessarily hard for themselves.
The match was not without controversy with a few niggles on both sides. In addition to the throat-slitting incident, a number of other St Neots players got a little heated and, not to be outdone, Bhav (who could probably get into an argument in an empty room) nearly got himself carded for a running battle with a couple of St Neots players.  Finally right at the death St Neots made a vociferous claim for a short corner which was denied by the umpires, as a consequence of which the St Neots player refused to shake hands at the end of the match. 
Fortunately however, the rest of the St Neots team did not hold any grudges. Due to Dave Aston's girlfriend dragging him away on holiday straight after the match (for which she earned herself a Lemon of the Match vote), there were not enough cars to transport the team back to Cambridge and Manu and Jack were very kindly given a lift back by one of the opposition!","Men's 2nds make hard work of beating St Neots 2","False","False",,1,"True","False",

South started the game with aplomb, with some of their best passing and moving hockey of the season starting to trouble the league's best defence. Mark Pears, Tim Clapp and Rob Leigh were looking increasingly dangerous in attack, whilst Jack Chalk was linking the defence with the midfield well.   
Up the other end, Horncastle were looking dangerous going forward, showing why they have scored over 130 goals so far this season. However, the defence were standing firm, being helped by the continuous running and tracking back of the four man midfield. When the defence was pierced, some excellent goalkeeping from Ben Buckley helped push a reverse stick effort round the post.
Then, towards the end of the half, South took the lead. Mark Pears raced on to a through ball from the left and attempted to bury a shot past the keeper.   The shot was well saved, but John Hawkes was on hand to lift the rebound over the defenders sticks into the goal.   On the balance of play at the time, this was a merited lead, and good further work by South ensured it stayed that way at half time.
Emerging after the break, Horncstle were almost level immediately, when a goalbound shot which beat Ben was stopped on the line by Manu.   Unfortunately this was with his feet, so a penalty flick was awarded. Ben however was not to be beaten, staring down his young adversary to ensure that the flick only hit the back of the football net behind the goal, and not the hockey net destination for which it was intended.
Buoyed by this, South set about extending their lead.   Again, the Horncastle keeper came to his side's rescue, smothering one on one attempts from both Robbie Leigh and Mark Pears. A further shot by Tim Clapp drifted agonisingly wide of the far post. 
Unfortunately, South were pegged back, and then fell behind midway through the half. The skilful opponent's front line pinged a ball across the D at pace, where after an intitial save from Buckley, the Horncastle forward swept in from close range.   This was soon added to from a short corner, expertly placed inside the bottom corner.   
South refused to lie down, and expert keeping again came to Horncastle's rescue when further one-one-ones were thwarted. Short corner attempts were also charged down or saved, and the game started to become stretched.  As South poured forward, a quick counter from Horncastle led to a game of pinball in the South D, with the opponent forward finally lifting the ball into the goal at the third attempt.
Despite one further short corner attempt being thwarted at the end, South were unable to come back, and the game finished 3-1. However, this was as good a performance as any this season and nobody should be downhearted- in fact most of the matches in which South have won the performance was nowhere near as good as Saturday's.   
The final match of the season sees South travel to Spalding- and a repeat performance from this weekend should see South finish the campaign with 3 points.","Men's 2nds beaten by Division leaders Horncastle 1","False","False",,1,"True","False",

The day started badly when we turned up and found our nice green shirts were almost (but not quite) identical to their nice green shirts. Fortunately the school leisure centre was open and we were able to change into a rather fetching purple, although the fact that they were clearly sized for primary school children meant that it wasn't the best look for our team. We shrugged off the early set-back, though, and set to work on playing hockey.
With 5 changes from the previous week's knock-about and the players still not fully used to the new formation things were set-up for a slow start. This didn't materialise, however, with South getting stuck in right from the first whistle and doing their best to unsettle the home side whenever they got the ball. On one early occasion, the hassling of Pears almost paid off when he snatched the ball from a hesitant defender and his cross was almost turned in at the far post by Sinclair.
The first goal wasn't long in coming, though, as Garrett pounced on the ball in the D to slot into the corner past the 'keepers dive. The second goal came mid-way through the half when a cross from the right-way found its way through to Cobbe on the p-spot and a cleanly stuck shot flew past the 'keepers left shoulder.
Harlow managed to gain some composure from this point and slowly clawed their way back into the game. Nonetheless, they didn't look like scoring until a lapse in concentration from the South defence allowed a free man to materialise in their ranks and Harlow capitalised to full effect.
The home side started the second half with renewed vigour and purpose, closing down South quickly and purposefully. Some more incisive passing saw them make some inroads into the away team's D, without actually creating any clear-cut chances. Fortunately, South were able to weather the early storm and soon after increased their lead when Sinclair tidied up a messy short-corner routine by coolly lifting a loose ball over the keeper. And the game was all but killed off mid-way through the half when another short-corner-gone-not-quite-to-plan was salvaged as the ball was crossed to Baker at the far post and he managed to slot the ball in the corner of the goal.
Harlow continued to push forward looking for a way back into the game but this just left them exposed at the back and South should have scored more goals as they hit the home side on the break. In the end, then, South will be disappointed not to have scored more goals and to have gained a clearer advantage before half-time. Better teams than this will be faced this year and South will need to be playing better to avoid making things difficult for themselves.

The heat had a tiring effect on both teams, especially as the game wore on, but at the start it was the home side that was sharper as South moved into a 3-0 lead before the break.  Vice Captain Hewitt was back in the starting line-up following an ankle injury but it didn't seem to have affected his shooting as he gave the home side the lead with a sharply struck short-corner.  Soon after the same trick worked again, though this time Garrett got a stick to it on the way to deflect it past the defender on the line.  And with the away side posing little desire of wanting to trouble the score-board, South scored a third just before half-time when a break down the right was pulled across goal for Tristen (?) to score.

It was a comfortable half for Cambridge South with Bishops Stortford trying to play high, keeping players deep in the South half, but struggling to cause the South back line any serious problems.  Readman was back in fine form (after missing the mid-week friendly against Royston), mashalling his troops in front of him and picking off the loose balls with ease.  The imperious Thorpe took no nonsense from the opposition forward, while Eliot took up an unfamiliar role at left-back and yet made it look like he'd played there all his life.  And on the right, Leo was a constant threat going forward with some excellent passing from dead-balls in the final third of the pitch.

In the second half the away side started to get back into the game, as South rotated the midfield and started to succomb to the heat of the day.  They continued to look the better side, though, and increased their lead again when Cobbe pounced on a loose ball in the D to snaffle it past the keeper.  Bishops Stortford scored a consolation goal when they managed to catch the home defence on the hop, an overlap on their left creating space for a free striker to fire past the 'keeper.  But South had the final say when another short corner gave a goal, this time Sinclair clipping a fine finish past the keeper when the push-out didn't go quite where it was intended.

Pears was a continual threat to the opposition back-line throughout, and was unlucky not to finish the game with a goal.  And on the left Cobbe and Knight linked up well, giving the side width going forward and solid defensive cover when Stortford had the ball.  On the right, Baker and Sinclair moved the ball well and opened up the opposition defence on a regular basis, keeping the Stortford defence on the back-foot.

In the end the score line was a fair reflection of the game, though it was disappointing to concede a goal after looking so comfortable in the first half.  Nonetheless, given the hot conditions and personnel changes from the previous game (again!) it was a decent result and the pre-season preparations continue well.

The game started evenly, with Nomads creating some good early chances before South came back into the game with their own opportunities to take the lead - Keith Hewitt putting the second over the bar after fine work from Chris Baker down the inside right channel - but the match turned when South scored 2 goals in the final 10 minutes of the half.  James Cobbe opened the scoring from close range before Mark Pears buried a cross from the right into the bottom corner.
From here it was always going to be difficult for Nomads to get back into the game but they stuck to their task gamely and kept South pinned back in their half as the second period began.  Pushing more players forward left gaps at the back, though, and South were able to take advantage.  In their only short-corner of the game Keith Hewitt struck to make it 3-0, before Rob Garrett added a fourth when he capitalised on a defender's miss-control in the D.
Nomads were able to pull one back at this point when a loose ball in the South defence was quickly pounced upon and dispatched past Shahbaz with nothing he could do to prevent it.  But South had the final say when Mark Pears grabbed his second of the game with a handy finish from close range.
Nomads will rue their missed chances in the first half, but after South took the lead they never looked like losing and fine performances throughout the team gave a well-deserved victory.

It didn't take long for the home side to get into their stride, with 4 goals without reply in the first 20 minutes.  Peterborough pulled one back, before Cambridge notched a 5th to effectively finish the game off before half-time.  To their credit, Peterborough never gave up and kept the pressure on in the second half but were unable to fashion any clear-cut chances.  The home side, in contrast, were dangerous on the break and added 3 more before the final whistle.  Goals came from James Cobbe (4), Mark Pears (2), Chris Baker and Keith Hewitt.
In the first league encounter of the new season Cambridge South were pitched against the unknown quantity of Peterborough 5ths.  The home side were in confident mood, though, playing at Fortress Leys and on the back of 4 wins in a row in their pre-season friendlies.  They were also bolstered by the return of Snetler - freshly recovered from a toe injury - and Johnson.  The latter was back after picking up an ankle injury in the 1-0 win over Royston.
And on another pleasant day in Cambridge it didn't take long for the home side to start scoring.  I didn't have my watch on me, but when Snetler came on after 10 minutes I'm sure we were at least 2 goals to the good.  The first came from a short corner.  Keith took the straight strike option and with great skill popped it in the bottom left corner.  By 'great skill' I mean 'topped it', but they all count, right?  You can't argue with the stats.  The second came from another short corner - this time a slip left to Baker and after the first shot was saved the second was judged to have been illegally stopped by the Peterborough defence on the line.  A flick was given and Baker duly dispatched it with clinical precision in the top left corner.  Third time lucky, I guess.
Johnson was showing no signs of his enforced break from hockey, frequently posing a threat on the right wing.  After 15 minutes he was released by Baker and as the last defender closed him down he slipped it across to Mark for South's 3rd goal of the game.  More reward was to be gained down the home-side's right with the fourth goal - this time Garrett outstripping the defender and driving in along the back-line before slipping it to Cobbe for a tidy finish at the back post.
It was at some point around here that Peterborough managed to get a goal back.  A quickly taken free hit into the D was touched on by the striker and sneaked in at the near post.  Disappointing for the home side, but they were quickly back up the other end and putting the ball back where it belonged.  This time Mark profited and was able to score his second of the game.  I can't remember exactly how it happened, but it probably involved Keith, Lukas and/or Baker at some point.  And maybe Russ too.  And James.  I don't know - they were all playing well - it could have been any of them, frankly.  Or all of them.
Anyway, that was half-time.  And I _can_ remember the second half goals.  Or more to the point, James can remember them all and he was gracious enough to go over them with me after the game so that I could get it down correctly in the match report.  He's so kind.  The 6th (his 2nd) was a quick break from that man Russ again and a square pass for an easy finish.  The 7th (his 3rd) came from Lukas 'reverse stick' Snetler trying the audacious in the D and only accomplishing a pile of bodies as he and defender came together in a manner not normally seen on the hockey pitch.  James has eyes only for one thing, though.  The ball.  And the goal.  Wait - that's 2.  Anyway, the 8th came when Garrett managed to get hold of the ball in the D and just as he was moving past defenders, waiting for the right moment to show Lukas how it's done on the reverse stick, James - ever the gentleman - solved the problem by burying it in the far corner.
To their credit, Peterborough never game up and were particularly difficult to play against in the second half.  By compressing the game and tackling in numbers they forced South onto the back foot.  A changed South back-line was able to keep them at arms length, though.  Graveling was pressed into service at right-back and Eliot was in at left-back for the second time this season.  The change didn't remove Graveling's no-nonsense hard-tackling, and with Eliot looking more and more assured at left-back with each game he plays there, Peterborough struggled to create much despite the pressure.  Regulars Jim and Matt were solid in the centre, supporting the attack when we were able to get the ball out.
Next week's game against Market Deeping should provide a sterner test for Cambridge, but this was an excellent way to start the new campaign.
""It was a solid all round display today.  We coped well with the pressure Peterborough put us under in the second half and were clinical in the final third.  I think everyone can be pleased with their performance"" said captain Rob Garrett

A well-balanced South side immediately created chances and the Deeping keeper, who saw plenty of action throughout, was twice called upon in the first five minutes, beating down a shot following a giveaway to the predatory Mark Pears and then blocking Russell Johnson on the doorstep.  HMS Jim Thorpe made light of the gale-force conditions, sailing ahead in full billow, while Rob Garrett repeatedly troubled the home defence, once cutting back from the right to test the keeper and give Johnson a rebound opportunity which went just wide.  Close stick control and a slick through pass from the classy Chris Baker again forced Deeping's last man to be proactive on the edge of the D, but he was finally stranded when a short corner won after Baker's later mazy dribble was slipped to the left for Pears to flick high into the net.
The visitors doubled their lead after 20 minutes when Thorpe, who had earlier artfully allowed a direct pass through his legs to feed South's waiting left wing, drove the ball imperiously upfield, where Pears collected on the reverse, tipped round the marooned defender and waited for the psychological moment before sliding home a very neat goal as the keeper was forced to commit.
Chris Graveling, mixing the robustly physical and the delicately aesthetic, picked off the few Deeping attacks with aplomb, aided by the always solid Leo Tomita and Nick Young, whilst providing swift feed to the midfield and wings.  As the half drew to a close, Deeping marked the South right more closely but there was plenty of firepower elsewhere and both Lukas Snetler and Eliot Read, who worked hard and unselfishly, had efforts that narrowly missed or were saved.  Three minutes before the break, following South's fourth short corner, Johnson hit the post after the ball had ping-ponged mercilessly round the D and Baker was on hand, as so often, to ram the ball without ceremony into the middle of the goal. 
Deeping started the second half vigorously, forcing Young into an excellent diving tackle and allowing Tomita to demonstrate how to floor an attacker without doing anything (terribly) illegal.  Garrett wisely tracked back to help out, Thorpe extricated himself from a couple of hassles and the ubiquitous Graveling won some space with his magnetic-ball-on-a-stick circling trick.  Gradually, the initiative was regained as South began to call, and deliver, the shots again.  Chances fell to Pears, Johnson and the busy Snetler but these were all stopped, and when the keeper was eventually rounded by Pears, a Deeping duo were back on the line to shepherd the ball away.
The home side had their first real opportunity after 53 minutes, when a good run by their persistent right-winger set up a striker in the D, but the lifted shot flew wide.  Immediately afterwards, South countered with their sixth short, a neat slip to the right which was crossed back for the tea-cosied Sanjay Agarwala to fire home via a slight defensive deflection.  Agarwala was then the prime mover in a sequence which ended with a Snetler reverse being blocked, a moment of dj vu coming a minute later after another penalty corner.
Deeping then broke dangerously free up front in their best move of the match but Steve Parker timed his tackle to perfection, advancing to the edge of the D and robbing the lone attacker with customary prestidigitatory skill.  The hosts, thus encouraged, exerted more pressure but South coped well, with Young and Garrett making precise interceptions and Agarwala pumping hard out of defence.  Tomita also brought off a big stop and, after Graveling had seen his flicked short blocked, Sir Thorpe calmly rescued a late giveaway and Snapper Read raced in like a ferret to make two late tackles and earn the shut-out.
This will by no means be the strongest team that South have to face - next week's opponents, Wisbech II, are traditionally awkward opponents and have had two decent wins so far as well - but in terms of developing team cohesion and a systematic approach, Saturday was a further valuable step on the road.","Men's 1sts go top of the League with a victory at Market Deeping.","False","False",,1,"True","False",

Skipper Rob Garrett gave South the perfect start, though, as he brought off a typical snatch-and-grab in midfield after just two minutes.  Blistering into the circle, he drew the keeper and sold the prospect of a late squared pass before slipping it neatly in via the direct route.  Though South looked confident, the younger Wisbech side were undaunted and there was plenty of robust work required from the defence, amongst whom Matt Readman shone throughout with a performance worthy of one of the grittier Icelandic sagas.  Chris Graveling excelled in the tackle, too, and his speciality of shielding the ball with his body so that the attackers were flattened by his backside was a treat to watch.  But coherence at the back was all, and both Eliot Read, marking furiously on the right, and the hawk-eyed Jim Thorpe in the middle kept their eye firmly on the ball for important breakdowns.
A surge up the left wing and keen interplay between Keith Hewitt and the ever-available Mark Pears promised much but Wisbech broke through the back line after 10 minutes when a deflected hit in whizzed past Steve Parker's left post.  There was a butterfly moment a couple of minutes later as a flat back pass came perilously close to a high Wisbech attacker, and this was soon followed by another hit deflected into the circle; meanwhile, Garrett had scattered three markers with a clever stick-head shimmy and Lukas Snetler - who also put in a deal of solid defensive duty - jiggled electrically upfield to feed Pears.  
Not for the first time, however, Wisbech threw up a doodlebug which dropped and bounced menacingly into the D but Parker was swiftly out to block with glove and pad as the clearance went past a phalanx of Wisbech attackers now running in the wrong direction.  After a sharp run up the right from Russell Johnson, Wisbech won their first short despite fierce resistance on the byeline from Readman.  The heavy drag flick was palmed away but adjudged to have come from outside the circle and play switched quickly to the other end as hypersubs Chris Baker and Al Sinclair made their bow.  Pears and the Wisbech keeper had a madcap sprint to the corner flag, where both were just preceded by the ball, before Snetler boomed a good drive past the post following Hewitt's slipped short.  Hewitt, aided by Baker, continued to hassle well up front, forcing the keeper to slide out, while Snetler was tenacious in the tackle and Thorpe turned elegantly on coinage equivalent to 2p to transform defence into attack.
Wisbech pressed more urgently at this stage, ragging the ball dangerously across the D with a string of passes, and after a couple of whacks in had failed to hit the target, they fashioned a good scoring opportunity in centre D but the attacker, with his back initially to goal, failed to turn quickly enough and struck wide.  In the meantime, Thorpe and Hewitt had hared up route one to give Pears a solo chance but the keeper narrowed the angle and Pears, seeking the obvious gap, shot into the pads.
Readman continued to earn his corn with dead-eye tackling and good distribution, notably to Sinclair, but a couple of minutes before the interval there was a collective marking failure as the visiting left winger penetrated the circle and reversed a pass to the penalty spot, from where the ball was smartly dispatched into the net.  The remainder of the half was end to end, with Leo Tomita making three great blocks in the left corner before Sinclair fashioned a big shot which was well saved.  Read and Graveling then had to repel boarders before Wisbech engineered a deflection which Parker kicked safely clear.
The pattern of ebb and flow persisted into the second half, with Graveling saving South in a hectic scramble in the D and Pears' sniping abilities resulting in a rifled shot into the keeper's pads which rebounded to the hungry Snetler, who looked sure to score with a reverse but was denied by an adroitly-placed defender on the line.  There was a lucky escape moments later as a long Wisbech ball from outside the circle hit the post and nearly found its way to a loitering attacker but the reverse aerial bat required for a shock goal was just beyond him.
As the hour mark passed, both sides continued to struggle for a definitive opening, with Hewitt forcing a kick out from the keeper and then charging up the midline and Johnson trying hard to replicate the nifty right-wing moves that so impressed in the warm-up.  Wisbech were equally forthright, especially down the middle and on the right flank, and Tomita did well to emerge from major harassment in South's left corner.  The central tendency resulted in some bunching and close personal contact, and there was an extraordinary incident in which Sinclair appeared to be caught in a headlock, but the umpires sensibly disentangled the two parties without fuss or cardage.  
As the endgame beckoned, Sinclair upped his work rate to accept good passes from Graveling and Thorpe, as well as making an incredible reverse stop while forechecking.  But Wisbech were looking increasingly ominous coming forward and with six minutes on the clock, broke clean away down the right channel with the South defence a pace behind.  Parker had judged the build-up coolly, though, and brickwalled the advance near the edge of the D with a resounding block.  
After Sinclair had again ground out an escape route to the well-placed Baker, a clash of sticks just outside the D led to Wisbech's second penalty corner, a cleanly-struck drive from which Parker made a full-stretch diving save with stick and gloves, leaving Readman to hoover the ball out to safety.  Wisbech were not finished, though, despite brief essays from Hewitt and Baker, and Graveling came up with a superb reverse clearance as Wisbech's third short was deflected towards goal.  Readman piled on the granite as Wisbech hacked away down the right, while Graveling had to be at his best not to foul when the circle was breached and the attackers maintained close control in probing for a gap.  Garrett was chopped down when searching for a last-minute run and Hewitt nearly got the ball up to the right corner in the closing moments but eventually the whistle blew with no advantage accruing to either side.
South may have felt slightly the more relieved at the end as the momentum was with the visitors at that point but the result was a fair one as both sides had their chances yet managed to largely cancel out the respective attacking threats with controlled defensive performances.  More cohesion on the right would probably have helped South spread the ball around more effectively and it would have been handy to get in the opposition circle more but Wisbech are certainly no pushovers and looked pretty solid in most areas.
All the other teams with a 100% record after last week have now dropped at least two points, so South remain top on goal difference.  There are clearly plenty of tough challenges ahead and the division is already looking intriguingly open.","Men's 1sts drew 1-1 with Wisbech Town 2","False","False",,1,"True","False",

The University, swift, aggressive and confident from the start, gave notice of their intent with early domination of the South half but, after their first penalty corner had been deflected, a warning shot was fired across their bows when the thrusting Mark Pears beat four men on a direct run and slipped a pass to Russell Johnson arriving on cue at the left post.  A firm second touch just eluded him as the goal thoughtlessly failed to bend to his will but South soon returned as Lukas Snetler mugged the home team's right winger and found Keith Hewitt close by.  Hewitt danced his way up the flank before locating Pears, who picked his spot low with the defence well out of position.
The University redoubled their attacking efforts and it required all the sang froid that Chris Graveling and Matt Readman could muster to hold them at bay.  They, as well as the classy Leo Tomita on the right and an unflappable Nick Young on the left, drew the sting with pinpoint tackling, drop-dead interceptions and swift distribution to the wings.  Rob Garrett masterminded escape routes up the middle, while Chris Baker, fully appreciating the value of the early ball, fed quickly to right and left and was never afraid to impersonate a brick outhouse with men coming towards him.  
Although the University continued to press from all areas, South developed the more effective impulsion going forward and another Readman-Snetler-Hewitt foray on the left side paved the way for Baker, finding himself in confined space at top left D, to play a cunning reverse scoop as daring as it was unpremeditated, with the result that the entire defence was wrong-footed as the ball found the bottom corner to double South's lead after 18 minutes.
Inexorable passing movements from the University were strangled by Young, Readman and Graveling and, when the ball did end up in a melee near the penalty spot, it was swiftly cleared upfield with a Hewitt cannon.  South brought their right flank more into play, with good triangles between Readman, Tomita and Eliot Read, Read once neatly nutmegging a University defender before laying off to Garrett.  Snetler displayed his Stakhanovite tendencies on the opposite side, feeding Hewitt, who was always threatening to rampage, but the University were never slow to turn defence to attack, forcing Readman and Tomita to pull off some death-defying tackles on the edge of the D.  The biter was soon bit, though, as Tomita himself quickly squared to Garrett, who threaded a needle's-eye pass through to Hewitt.  The Tassie Terror, cruising smoothly into the D, then slipped the ball in for the third as the home defence was again made to look static.
South's first-half performance, in which they never allowed the opposition to get in from the by-line whilst poaching brilliantly themselves, inspired greater confidence on the ball at the start of the second half and more continuous possession was the result, especially in the right-sided link between Tomita, Read and Johnson.   Continued vigilance was required at the back, however, and the ubiquitous Garrett was one minute found reverse-tackling on his own back-line and the next ragging the ball cross-field to Pears, whose first-time flick was unlucky to be denied by a reflex stick save from the home keeper.  
When the University finally managed to penetrate into the D, Readman put on his Santa Pod boots to rescue matters with a last-ditch poke away, but there was no respite as a home striker then found just enough room for a wicked rising reversed shot which Steve Parker in goal saw all the way, mastering it with his blocker before kicking to safety.  South's resistance was finally broken after 50 minutes, though, when a slipped short was threaded back through the centre for an unmarked striker to tap home on the post.
This upped the ante for a thrilling last quarter, where each of South's rotating subs - not to say their breathless supporters - got through a substantial portion of fingernail.  Garrett read an aerial cleverly, Young relieved pressure in the centre and Graveling made a clearance in desperando on the by-line.  A fifth University short was stopped in its tracks by Young, who then stuck to the ball like glue as he manoeuvred it out through three onrushers, while Hewitt made the most of South's interludes of possession up front to try and drive the ball on to the hard-running Pears.  South were indebted, too, to Garrett's uncanny reverse interceptions and telescopic tackling as the University explored all avenues from East to West, although Readman proved his equal in a tremendous all-action spell in the centre.
As the final ten minutes approached, it was all hands to the pump as Young deflected for a long, Snetler - fresh from a breather - made a key interception and Tomita whipped the ball straight off an attacking stick on the edge of the D.  South then put together a thrilling coast-to-coast move at the end of which Snetler narrowly missed the left-hand post with a trademark reverse.  The University for once got in round the back of the visiting defence and crossed menacingly but Parker was foursquare and kicked resoundingly out to touch.
Two more home penalty corners came and went as Young held the midfield, Readman threw himself into the fray with a diving tackle and Parker was out to block.  The University increased the volume, clustering wholesale in the 25, but South held their lines brilliantly, with Read, Readman and Graveling all making crucial interventions and Baker sacrificing his body with a will when being dumped as he took the ball to safety.  The home side's threat was eventually extinguished in the last couple of minutes when Johnson took command up the right and squared to the waiting Hewitt, who confused stick with boot, and South ended on top as a screamer from Snetler just whizzed past the top right of the University goal.
South can be justly pleased with this very gutsy and committed display, in which the opposition's frequent substitutions perhaps proved more of a hindrance than a help to their flow, and it was of particular note that individual players seemed to be settling well in appropriate positions, thus facilitating greater cohesion over wider areas of the pitch.  The team remain top of Division 3NW on goal difference, with the dangerous Rutland next on the agenda.","Men's 1sts maintain their stranglehold on Div 3 with a win at Cambridge University.","False","False",,1,"True","False",

Hewitt, Snetler, Thorpe et al. (Sinclair, that is) and who were further discomposed by the late arrival of James Cobbe and Russell Johnson thanks to untimely congestion on that matchless paragon of East-West quantum teleportation known as the A14.
Skipper Rob Garrett won a ten-minute concession on starting time and Ian Glover nobly stepped into the breach despite not being 100% fit, so South were able to begin with a complement that was full if not the one originally selected.  Initial signs were reasonably promising, with Garrett himself and Baker feeding well off each other and attacking the Rutland D, and South soon won a short corner which was slipped, neatly returned by Chris Graveling but then deflected for a long.  However, Rutland, taking a more direct route than the University last week, had already got round the back to fire across the goal once and soon found the penalty spot again, where Nick Young and Leo Tomita were on hand to stop and clear.  The visitors did not have long to wait for their reward, though, as their first penalty corner, a direct strike from an opposite-side injection, was unluckily tipped in off a South stick after nine minutes.
South tried hard to build moves sensibly from the back but were repeatedly frustrated by a mobile Rutland midfield that squeezed the wings and allowed little more space in the middle.  Richard Morgan and Eliot Read made the best of a cloying, sandy patch up the right and Read had a shot at goal deflected after Garrett's effort had seen the keeper miskick.  Graveling, Garrett and Readman all made important reverse tackles as Rutland moved quickly forward but the visitors had the knack of getting a man clear of the defence while South's approaches through enemy lines tended to fizzle out when confronted at the edge of the D.  Eventually, though, a slightly more promising shape emerged, leading to a good run round the back by Garrett, after Graveling had set Read up for the pass, and a forceful drive through by Baker, who saw the ball just run away from him.  A five-minute spell of pressure from Rutland, in which Tomita made a crucial late save on two free men and Graveling tackled decisively as Young shadowed, was followed by the visitors' second short, smartly cleared by Graveling to Cobbe.  Cobbe neatly fed Pears running forward but the latter lacked support and further probes by Baker, Pears and Cobbe in the Rutland 25 all foundered before threatening the danger zone.
Garrett's chin then had the misfortune of crossing paths with a Rutland stick, ruling him out of the rest of the match, so Glover was once more called into the fray as South tried to stabilise in the five minutes before half-time.  Rutland stepped up a gear, winning a third short, but a firm strike met a textbook stop from keeper Steve Parker followed by a cool clearance from Graveling on the pads.  Parker then made an important save on his right post, reacting quickly to get a reflex stick on an attempted lifted tip-in from a swift through ball.
The break gave South a chance to regroup, with coach David Grammer emphasising the need for width, short passes and quick movement and, indeed, confident work round the back from Tomita, Matt Readman and Cobbe suggested sensible commitment to possession.  But Rutland continued to keep men high and the defence came under increasing pressure despite individual forays from Pears and Glover.  Parker made another excellent save on his right post after a slick incursion into the D and then blocked a well-struck short corner but he and Graveling, attempting to clear, were overwhelmed by numbers as the ball was despatched to double South's deficit after 46 minutes.
Rutland had let slip an identical lead against Spalding last week but were clearly in no mood to repeat the feat, ramming the foot to the floorboards and breaking free at the edge of the D, where they were again stonewalled by a great tackle from Parker, who then recovered, retreated and saved once more with his stick.  Graveling was almost immediately adjudged to have fouled outside the D, giving Rutland another short corner opportunity, but the defence were now beginning to read the injector's deceptive timing and Parker dived agilely to his right to block a first-time shot.
Despite best efforts, South continued to have difficulty in clearing their 25 and Pears, lurking high to get on the end of a route-one breakout, had his work cut out to see much of the ball.  Two fine reverse interceptions and tackles in extremis from Readman and an equally solid series of blocks from Tomita kept the immediate threat at bay but Rutland exploited their art of winning penalty corners to suffocate any concerted drive forward.  Parker was in action with his blocker for the seventh, Tomita clearing, before the eighth was turned into a counter-attack with several good cross-field moves.  Morgan, who had remained steady under constant scrutiny, then set up Johnson to hare round the back of the visiting defence and South finally won a trio of set-pieces for themselves.  A flick from Baker after a slip to the right looked promising but hit a Rutland body and South's fourth and final short was sticked away by the keeper from a Pears effort.
From then on, it was more Rutland shorts punctuated by brief intervals of open play, the notable interventions being made by Parker, twice saving big hits, along with Graveling and Young, who unfussily tidied up awkward stuff coming into the D. 
This was a game that South never particularly looked like winning, hamstrung as they were by the loss of their chief playmaker with less than half the game gone and perhaps a little short of power in the engine-room, but they should take credit for a stout defensive display, both in general and at the set-piece.  The visitors fluffed only two of their twelve penalty corner attempts but their conversion rate was low, reflecting good goalkeeping and disciplined clearance strategies.  There was a pleasing absence of panic, despite the fact that Rutland made it very difficult to get any regular ball beyond the halfway line, and South worked hard enough to ensure they kept themselves in the game until very nearly the end.
Stiff challenges lie ahead, however, and South know that they need to field their best side on a regular basis to make serious headway in what is again shaping up to be a closely-contested division. ","Men's 1sts suffer a first defeat of the season to Rutland 1.","False","False",,1,"True","False",

In the event, South were grateful for a decisive start which saw Mark Pears net on the three-minute mark after Rob Garrett and Lukas Snetler's fast approach work had sliced the defence well and truly open.  No less important in creating the early advantage was South's ability to read City's well-taken short corners, with both Steve Parker and Chris Graveling dealing firmly with high and low flicks.  The balance of the play was in South's favour for much of the first half and all the best chances fell their way, Keith Hewitt smashing high into the side-netting from a tight angle and Snetler unluckily clanging the post with a rasping shot after burgling the ball at the edge of the D.  After City were temporarily reduced to ten men through injury, South continued to force the pace, Rob Garrett being denied by the keeper's stick and Pears doing well to get in a first-time shot which also found the goalie.  The pressure eventually told on the home side, however, and, on 23 minutes, an after-you-Cecil-no-after-you-Claude moment deep in the City circle allowed Snetler to race in and pick his spot for a well-deserved personal marker.
Neat footwork from Chris Baker at right-half and Al Sinclair's gift for finding a gap and storming into it threatened to derail City's defence but, after Snetler's crisp strike at the first short had been well saved by the keeper and the second had run through plans A, B and C and ended up on the half-way line, the hosts organised themselves more efficiently and started to exert some pressure themselves.  Eliot Read, Nick Young and Matt Readman - the latter eventually cottoning on to the new self-pass rule and making some great moves to himself - all put in key tackles and Graveling's omnipresence was reassuring.  Sinclair was blocked twice in the opposition D after hot chases near the whistle but South appeared to be in good order at half-time.
Restored to numerical parity, City redoubled their efforts on the restart.  Urged on by sensible advice from their coach and the tireless efforts of their veteran striker, whose perennial jousts with Graveling formed an entertaining fil rouge, the hosts threw their weight around, barging over Read and Garrett, and shrugged off near-misses by Sinclair, Baker and Russell Johnson to reduce the deficit after 46 minutes when the South defence went AWOL and a loose forward leathered home from space on the right.
A certain degree of hairiness took over as City caught the scent and South were grateful for the umpire's vigilance in ruling out a home goal after a pinball effort following Parker's fine diving save from a flicked penalty corner had been bundled in through a forest of bodies.  Hewitt then attempted to restore the two-goal cushion with a self-sacrificial dive on City's left post but his despairing reverse shot just went wide.  After failing to convert a third short through lack of ball speed, South then concentrated on building up moves from deep but were apt to be dispossessed before getting into the danger area, though Read managed to get a brace of neat crosses in before City recovered themselves.
A pivotal moment came in the 57th minute when City, seeking the equaliser, engineered a quick two-on-one just inside the South 25 but Parker foiled the bid with a decisive spread tackle to his right and South breathed again, reorganising calmly to put together some solid moves round the back and then up the left through Garrett, Sinclair and Snetler.  The final critical pass remained elusive, however, until Sinclair robbed a City defender moving aggressively upfield and hared away to feed the waiting Hewitt.  Pears, meanwhile, had broken away from his marker and was in perfect position to put away an exquisite one-timer under the keeper when Hewitt judged the moment to pass.
To their credit, City still came on strong and it required a concerted effort from the South defence to hold on to their lead.  Garrett boosted the immune system with some great low tackles and Leo Tomita, whose well-disguised distribution from right defence had been a key factor in gaining South ground throughout the game, put in a determined reverse slide to clear in a tricky situation.  Nevertheless, City still won three late short corners and South were again indebted to a pair of excellent saves from Parker, the second a telescopic diving effort away to his right, to avert late embarrassment.  The third whistled just wide and, as Hewitt and Young banged the ball upfield to a grateful Snetler, South whistled with relief as the final whistle sounded.
Though South tended to give the ball away in midfield too much in the second half, many of the basics on which the team is trying to build were effectively executed.  Stabilised by the twin defensive bulwarks of Readman and Graveling and benefiting from a little more zing up front than last week, South gave themselves enough solidity at the back to reap the full benefit of the chances they manufactured at the other end.  A good result.","Men's 1sts keep up their challenge with a fine win against Cambridge City 4","False","False",,1,"True","False",

Chris Graveling had earlier had a slipped flick shot from one of South's three penalty corners well stopped, while Steve Parker came up with the goods when stonewalling a free attacker in his only glimpse of action.  But this was in truth a good, solid all-round performance against one of South's closest rivals, who were equally determined in all areas of the pitch.

The first half was played largely in torrential rain and the second in a howling gale which froze rather than dried and there were plenty of numb hands and legs throughout.
The game was really won and lost with only 20 minutes on the clock although the first half of this period gave no particular hint of the setbacks in store.  Lukas Snetler forced a good left-foot save from the home keeper after a cross from an in-form Russell Johnson and, while Steve Parker also had to glance a shot clear, South won two early shorts and both Chris Graveling and Keith Hewitt, the latter in an unaccustomed right-back position, made assured tackles.
The match turned decisively after just 10 minutes, however, when what looked to be a mishit from a St. Ives player just inside the South D freakishly wrong-footed or unsighted four players and rolled leeringly into the back of the goal.  Then two minutes later, a strike from the opposite side of the circle, which appeared to be covered all the way, unluckily deflected from a South stick and shot into the roof of the net to double the hosts' lead.
Both Johnson and Mark Pears made convincing runs round the left and right corners respectively and Hewitt again tackled well in a crisis but St. Ives, with a mixture of keen youngsters and some experienced older heads, competed fiercely for every ball.  Bulldozing their way round the by-line, they won a penalty corner, from which they hit the post and gained a rebound that fell kindly with the South defence stranded and the goal conveniently exposed.
South won another brace of short corners before the half was over, with Hewitt's slip to the far post cannily intercepted and Snetler's crisp strike deflected away from danger, and both Hewitt and Johnson had good shots saved.  In addition, the St. Ives keeper was rescued by his left-back when rounded by a Pears-Johnson combination, but the home side remained generally in control for the remainder of the half and showed plenty of fluent passing movements despite the wet going underfoot. 
Appreciating the need to attack, Rob Garrett had already returned Hewitt to his normal marauding position up front, with James Cobbe filling in very capably at right back in his stead.  Ron Oren displayed his usual solidity under fire on the left and, with Graveling and Matt Readman also working hard and Parker out and across smartly to thwart St. Ives' one real breakaway, South steadied the ship in the second stanza.  They also created chances for, in the first few minutes, both Graveling and Hewitt had tested the keeper, while Snetler later created space for a well-hit reverse but again could only find the pads.
Johnson's pace was always a threat up the right wing yet the home defence was unshakeable and, though South explored all avenues, led by Garrett's endless endeavour, there was no way through to goal.  A couple of notable surges from Readman and some well-orchestrated triangles involving Chris Baker, Snetler and a hard-running but luckless Pears showed promise but St. Ives, who used the self-pass rule to good effect to continually harass the South midfield and defence, pressed hard to the end, urged on by a vociferous crowd.  The award of their fourth short corner with five minutes to go was celebrated with a roar of triumph, from both players and onlookers, that betokened a certain ambition.  Although newly promoted and not currently in the top six, even after this victory, St. Ives look to be a well organised side and will prove difficult to overcome if they continue in this vein.
South afterwards had no complaints about the result, although there was some justified speculation as to whether things might have turned out differently had that first peculiar goal not been conceded.
In a group of teams jockeying for position behind Spalding at the head of the table, South have now dropped to fourth and need to regain their momentum if they are to continue their challenge for a promotion spot.  Next Saturday sees a home fixture against the eponymous Nomads in the tropical verdure formerly known as Coldham's Common and it will be interesting to see how the two teams try to hack their way through the undergrowth in search of the magical points.","Men's 1sts are disappointed to lose 3-0 at St Ives 2","False","False",,1,"True","False",

At least one assumes that's what the ten tons of sand disguising the hockey pitch are doing there ...
Lukas Snetler, clearly a budding South African beach hockey international, generously opined that it would probably get faster once the sand had compacted a bit but, for most, the slow surface put something of a brake on proceedings and there were several incidents in the first quarter of an hour to remind players of the need for care.  Hitting round the defence required some allowance for the inertia factor, as both South and Nomads found out almost to their cost, and the ball needed constant encouragement to keep it in motion.
Nevertheless, there was plenty of action from the off, with Mark Pears shooting just wide after a nice free hit move involving Rob Garrett and Matt Readman, and Nomads taking the coefficient of friction out of the equation with a subtly-placed aerial which gave their left-winger free room in the D.  Steve Parker raced across to block any further progress with a crunching tackle, though, and Pears nearly turned the tables immediately by intercepting a decelerating cross-pass and charging the keeper, only to see his shot from a rebound cleared off the line.
Nomads surged back, carving out a close-range chance from a left-wing cross but Parker was again equal to the shot, deflecting it with his stick for a long.  After flying right to cover a weighty drag-flick that went just wide from Nomads' first short, he then relieved pressure with a kick to the wings as the visitors once more entered home territory and, when what would normally have been a routine back-pass was sabotaged by the heavy going and seized on by the opposition, he sprinted out hard and challenged the striker to lift it, which he duly did, about six feet over the bar.
Coinciding with the arrival of Richard Morgan from school duties to make up a full complement, things started to take a less frenetic turn.  Snetler and Chris Baker combined neatly to broach the Nomads' circle, Pears pinched the ball off the left-half and Ron Oren and Eliot Read played sensible and constructive passes, though it was still difficult to retain possession as interceptions were made easier by the slow conditions.  Jim Thorpe covered back smartly on a dangerous through ball, engineering the attacker out of harm's way and clearing consummately, before putting in a superb tackle on the by-line as a tricksy run from the wing threatened to go all the way.  Nomads forechecked astringently, making it hard for South to find safety, and deservedly won a second penalty corner, from which Parker made an agile pad stop to his right from close range.  Shortly ahead of the break, Baker, Garrett and Snetler again penetrated Nomads' D before being halted by a well-packed defence, while the dynamic Snetler cleverly released Pears, whose attempted reverse at goal was slightly off-centre.  The half closed with the resourceful Thorpe putting up a daring and even elegant aerial ball to set up a fluent crossfield move which was unlucky not to reap further reward.
Having put away the buckets and spades, South knuckled down and enjoyed a composed spell of play in which James Cobbe excelled with skilful and tenacious work up the left touchline and Oren cleared his zone with authority.  A feisty run from Snetler led to a Garrett cross from which Baker hit the keeper, and the latter had to kick out again shortly afterwards as Cobbe hovered close.  Nomads had their moments, once breaking through to the edge of the D before Readman put a stop to the malarkey and then bursting through on a turnover only to see Parker shepherding the ball to safety, but the better moves were mostly South's.  Garrett's cross after a 30-yard run was blocked, while Thorpe, whose howitzers from defence peeled a few layers of sand from the ball, shelled a 16 to Pears but the resulting pass across the D narrowly eluded Garrett.
After a bout of earnest hacking in the Nomads' circle, South finally won their first short and a smooth injection from Pears coupled with a pin-sharp stop from Read gave Snetler the opportunity to rifle home off the keeper's left pad on 55 minutes.  The setback appeared to galvanise Nomads, however, and though South's pace on the left side was always menacing, the visitors upped a gear as their first-team captain, recovering from injury though unfortunately afflicted by a chronic bout of the verbals, bolstered the front line.  Readman, Thorpe and Baker all made common-sense clearances, Read and Oren got rid well under pressure and Morgan - virtually invisible from the far side of the pitch under the ghostly penumbra cast by the floodlights (sic) - gave the indistinct impression of moving the ball swiftly and efficiently.  A firm crack away by Thorpe followed by a fine interception and run from Snetler kept the play away from South's end for a while but Nomads, reversing the flow, won a free hit outside the circle and play continued seamlessly as they exploited the self-pass rule.  The South defence, momentarily caught napping, were out of position and, with options available, the ball was squared for an easy tap-in with five minutes to go.
South did their best to grab a late winner as Garrett took responsibility, repeatedly driving forward at pace to find Pears, who, moments after unluckily failing to win a short, placed himself in the ideal position for a great pass from the skipper but was unable to convert as the ball, now resembling a scotch egg, malignly mistook foot for stick.
The sands of time quickly ran out as South, again without several key players, contemplated the loss of two points which would have seen them move into third place and overtake their next opponents, March II, who suffered an 8-0 drubbing at the hands of Spalding.  A drawn game between Wisbech II and City of Peterborough IV worked in South's favour but clearly South cannot afford to give up many more points against lower-placed teams if they are to maintain their challenge in the chasing pack.","Men's 1sts draw with Cambridge Nomads 2nds","False","False",,1,"True","False",

South made the ideal start when, after several good cross-field moves, Chris Baker picked out an advancing Matt Readman (see later!), whose neat pass to Lukas Snetler set up the perfect feed for Mark Pears to find an angle past the March keeper with barely two minutes played.  The score could easily have been doubled a minute later when Russell Johnson, benefiting from Pears' aggression in the left corner, unselfishly opted to pass rather than shoot but saw the ball slide past Keith Hewitt's stick on the overlap.
March soon gave notice of their presence, however, when firing just wide of Steve Parker's goal on a reverse and there were some marking issues outside the D before Rob Garrett charged down a strike on March's first penalty corner.  With the hosts favouring the counter-attacking long-ball tactic, South soon found that conceding possession in midfield was not a great idea and concentrated on retention and distribution.  Baker, James Cobbe and Snetler were all assiduous in this respect and they were helped by the excellent positional sense of debutant Graham McCulloch, who ran intelligently to make himself available throughout.  Swift movement across the top of the circle allowed him a fair shot which drew a good pad save from the home keeper, who then covered on his post to keep out an effort from Pears on the rebound.
March hit back, manoeuvring a ball from their right across to the far post, where Parker dived full length to block with stick and gloves before Cobbe unobtrusively accompanied the ball to safety.  The hosts repeatedly tried to bang the ball into the D for a possible deflection but South's ability to stop it stone dead and whisk it out smartly tended to close down the attacking threat as well as give opportunities to the pacy trio of Johnson, Garrett and Hewitt for counter-insurgency.  From one such breakdown, Hewitt's carefully disguised aerial (the one that doesn't leave the ground) found Johnson, who accelerated confidently to outpace a defender before cleverly drawing the keeper out of position and firing home from a narrow angle.
South continued to dominate overall, though Ron Oren had to be uncompromising at the back to ward off some unwanted attentions and Hewitt made a renewed bid for the Australian skeleton bob team at the Winter Olympics with a full-length head-first dive across his own D.  With Garrett dropping back to hoover up the high forwards and Readman in top form with his interceptions, March were starved of the ball and Hewitt, Johnson and Snetler all went close to scoring.  The home keeper made a good save to thwart Baker's flick from a Hewitt slipped short but March were unable to resist for long as Hewitt converted a Pears cross from the left with a lifter which glanced off the blocker on the way in.  The irrepressible Pears, put away by Oren and Garrett, then made it 4-0 when he mugged a defender and stuffed away his own rebound when a clearance failed to materialise.
March persisted with the route one strategy, which nearly bore fruit as a striker broke free on the edge of the D and fired goalwards, but Parker was right on top of him to absorb the energy and deflect the shot away.  Further pressure on the beleaguered March rearguard yielded a dangerous cross from Hewitt which was sticked away with two men waiting on the far post and shots from Baker and McCulloch which were stopped.  Shortly afterwards, Johnson again made the most of a vacant tract on the right and, seeing a yawning gap at the edge of the D, Readman - spurred on by the altruistic urgings of his vice-captain - stepped up to the play, received the squared pass and coolly picked his spot as to the manner born.  This aesthetically satisfying move, decorated by its consummate finish, put South ahead by five but March heads did not drop and, in addition to Parker kicking out, Cobbe, solidly, Hewitt, with a fine reverse tackle, and Oren, bravely getting in the way of a boomer, all had to put themselves on the line.  After this onslaught, March finally managed to reduce the deficit shortly before the break when a fiercely-struck, dipping short corner thudded in just below the top of the backboard.
Seemingly unfazed by the scoreline, the home team persisted with their tactics and, though struggling to cope with the pace of South's strike force, they did not fold.  Snetler's reverse earned a rebound chance which was not accepted and the keeper was again alert in denying the same player after a fast run and cross from Johnson had once more exposed the defence.  Johnson himself nearly scored from a batted shot that was just scrambled away from the post, while McCulloch unluckily had a goal disallowed.  Yet at the same time, Garrett and Snetler had to work hard in defence, Garrett blocking a crisp shot and then intercepting a hit in before Snetler pumped out to the wings.  Parker, too, needed all his speed to close down a March attacker at top D, resoundingly blocking the daylight with a sliding dive which saw the strike cannon into the pads.
The spirit of fair play was shown to be alive and well when, after some generous or lenient umpiring depending on your point of view, a March player graciously apologised to Pears for an over-manly challenge but Pears, whilst equally graciously accepting the apology, exacted revenge a minute later when sweeping a slipped short high into the top corner for his tenth goal of the league season after Snetler had been unceremoniously hacked down.  The five-goal cushion did not last long, however, as South were penalised for knocking the ball away and, in the ensuing hiatus caused by a 10-yard gain and a doubtfully lifted free hit, entanglement occurred near the visitors' penalty spot, allowing a waiting forward to poach a daft goal.
Thus emboldened, March won a trio of penalty corners, Parker coming to the rescue on the first, with two ground-level saves after a horribly topped strike had led to a quagmire of bodies, and the third, when an artful injection to an unsuspected angle gave the attacker a direct chance which was elegantly diverted away.  Snetler then had an entertaining shoulder-to-shoulder battle with his marker all the way up the left touchline - Snetler chivvying the ball with him throughout - while Readman brought down a lifted hit (of which there an increasing number that should really have been penalised) with all the skill of a lacrosse player.  March kept tanking forward, however, and brought the score back to 6-3 when a cross from the right disappeared into a central knot of players of both sides and eventually emerged into the back of the South goal.  
With 12 minutes still to go, you could sense March were beginning to think the unthinkable and it was a good thing their sixth short, a decent flick, was deflected out of harm's way.  Resisting the temptation to get headlessly sucked into the vortex, South re-established control as Readman saved a turnover and Baker calmly distributed to Snetler.  McCulloch was still making himself prominent, showing some pleasing right-time right-place attributes, and Hewitt too had plenty of energy left, accelerating over short distances to gain ground.  A good strike from him at South's fourth short was well saved on the deck, while both Pears and McCulloch had efforts kicked away.  Snetler almost swung himself off his feet with an air shot owing to slight misalignment of the feet but redeemed himself with a nifty run up the left before Johnson tracked back swiftly to rescue a deflected through ball and, finally, Garrett twice more tormented the March defence by whirring silently up the middle until last-ditch interventions halted him.
The 6-3 scoreline perhaps flattered March a little, although they creditably never let the early large margin overawe them, and it was a moot point whether South had subconsciously relaxed a little when the general mirth surrounding a March player who took a ball firmly amidships when attempting to control an aerial from one of his own team-mates temporarily seemed to take a bit of the sting out of the game shortly after half-time.   
Be that as it may, South can be very pleased with their performance up front, with all the forwards (and even some others!) showing the pace and smoothness they can generate given room to manoeuvre.  Praise is also due to the back division, who made light of sundry absences and stood up well to the traditionally robust challenge offered by the hosts.  Defeats for Wisbech and City of Peterborough and a draw for Rutland over the weekend all worked in South's favour and they now regain second spot behind leaders Spalding, next week's visitors.  Rumours that Sky are diverting their hockey coverage from the Champions' Trophy in Melbourne to this substantially more exciting and important top-of-the-table clash at Coldham's Common appear a touch exaggerated at the moment but watch this space.","Men's 1sts move back up the table with a good win at March","False","False",,1,"True","False",

South managed the best opportunities in the first 10 minutes as both Keith Hewitt and Chris Baker, looking sharp, had shots saved, while Matt Readman, relishing the challenge at the back, tackled succinctly and Graham McCulloch showed a fine turn of speed to head off trouble in his own D.  Debutant Manu Bhardwaj impressed with his calm clearances but Spalding drew first blood after 12 minutes when an obviously well-rehearsed penalty corner routine drew the South defence en masse to the left as the ball was returned swiftly to the centre and slotted home without fuss.
South's first short, a straight drive from Hewitt, drew a looping rebound that had the other forwards piling in but weight of numbers from the defence kept it out and the action reverted to South's end as some indecision over marking left Steve Parker having to clear as Spalding bore down on him.  A horrible slow-running long ball that struck a post nearly caught everyone out but, thankfully, Parker had guarded his near side and was able to spoil a golden opportunity for the visitors.  A desperate clearance from the committed Hewitt, flailing his stick at the ball like a polo player on a runaway pony, rescued a nasty moment inside South's 25 before Rob Garrett made one of his many incisive central forays which ended up with Mark Pears hitting into the side board after drawing a surprised keeper further than he wanted to go and just rounding him.
Spalding then got a man clean away up the right but Parker timed the challenge perfectly on the edge of the circle, the ball deflecting way off to his left to buy precious breathing space.  A second Spalding short broke down and Eliot Read pounced on the free ball to make welcome ground upfield as South forced the visiting keeper to clear.  A shot from Baker, put into position by Hewitt, and a flick from Pears which was batted down, could both have secured the equaliser but, despite further good work from Garrett and excellent interpassing from Read and the always tricky Al Sinclair, Spalding retained their narrow lead at half-time.
Matters continued evenly after the break, to the unsurprising accompaniment of yet more rain, as Hewitt had a surge, Spalding banged a right-wing cross through the D and Readman, Read and Chris Graveling combined to move the ball slickly forward at speed.  A back pass that ran out of legs then put Graveling in a difficult situation and, in the rush for the loose ball, he and a Spalding player fell after becoming entangled, each believing himself to be the victim.  Heated protests threatened to become unsavoury and it required all of umpire Matt Bailey's considerable powers of diplomacy to prevent a degeneration.  The two protagonists were both given five minutes to cool off but the game took on a rather more physical aspect after this that never quite abated.
South's dander was up, at any rate, and after a shot from the only short corner of the half was saved by the away keeper, Hewitt finally opened up the defence big time, slipping a neat pass through to Sinclair, who rattled it into the far corner with aplomb after 45 minutes .  This only served to make Spalding redouble their efforts, however, and, though James Cobbe retained lengthy possession in left midfield with some pleasingly dainty touches, the visitors attacked from several angles and Parker was required to kick adroitly out from various parts of the D.  Stretching wide, he then made an excellent save just inside his left post but Spalding had a man in close who forced it home while the defence was out of range.
Increasing use was being made of the airborne route by Spalding and they nearly got through again, Parker denying them on the byline before the play was blown up, but South resumed a measure of control through Cobbe and Garrett, while Read continued to tackle hard.  There was a distinct edge to the game at this point, with umpire Bailey having to remind both captains of their responsibilities and firmly encourage one of the more vociferous Spalding players to take a vow of silence, and play proceeded in robust fashion as each side struggled to gain an advantage.  Readman, never one to shirk with the mud flying, played a blinder at the rear, tackling and clearing with grim determination, while Hewitt put himself about appropriately in most areas of the field.  Bhardwaj made an important challenge as last man to deny a Spalding attacker on the prowl before Pears again shot into the side of the goal from a narrow angle and Garrett, always a source of hope with his threading runs, swallowed up the ground in midfield but waited just a mite too long to get the ball into the D.  South tried desperately to get the ball into the danger area as the clock ticked down but Spalding successfully held them at bay to reinforce their position at the top of the table.
There was never much of a gap between the two sides on the day and either could easily have won.  South can feel pleased to have largely negated the visitors' scoring threat, in particular by holding them to just three short corners, and will possibly feel they deserved at least a point as they did manufacture several scoring opportunities of their own.  It was not South's strongest side - with the influential Lukas Snetler, Russell Johnson and Jim Thorpe being among the absentees and Al Sinclair bravely rising from his sickbed - but the team on the day fought with considerable passion, commitment and no little skill.  Particular praise is also due to umpires Steve Riches and Matt Bailey, who handled a difficult game with tact and skill and retained exemplary calm and objectivity after the match when Spalding rather laboured the point over a perceived earlier grievance.
At the halfway point of the schedule, South lie fourth in a tight knot of six or seven teams with very similar records.  Any of these are capable of beating any other on a given day, with most of them having strong defences behind moderate firepower, so it is well nigh impossible to predict who will end up as the leading candidate to challenge for promotion behind favourites Spalding.  South will look back on the first half and be particularly chuffed with victories over the Light Blues and Peterborough IV, disappointed with a draw against Nomads and still slightly bemused over defeat to an unwontedly strong St Ives second team.  With commitment, availability and fitness, however, good results in the second half are not beyond them.
It would be nice, too, if someone saw fit to cart a few tons of sand off the Abbey pitch and give it a damn good haircut while they're at it.  Oh, and a few thousand more lux on the floodlights wouldn't go amiss either.","Men's 1sts lose to Spalding 1sts","False","False",,1,"True","False",

It was clear from the start that South, 8-1 victors over the same side in the first game of the season, were going to find things much tougher this time round.  Missing several regulars themselves and faced with an opposition comprising a committed (and vocal) blend of youth and experience, they were under pressure for much of the first ten minutes.  An early short corner was successfully charged down but most of the danger came from a nippy right winger who was unafraid to take his man on and made good use of the self-pass rule at free hits.  Ron Oren had to be at his very best to nullify this threat and his sterling efforts at this early stage were critical in preventing Peterborough getting away to a flyer.  South eventually prised themselves free, however, and their first real chance came on the ten-minute mark when Rob Garrett, always a handful for the home defence, scooted up the left and found Mark Pears, whose attempt at rounding the keeper was foiled by a late diving stick.  Pears then hounded down a long ball into the corner and squared to Garrett, but the latter's shot was slightly miscued and even a tip-on from Russell Johnson failed to redirect it to the target.
Richard Morgan and Chris Graveling were being kept busy at the back as Peterborough persistently played a man high but it was Oren who started the deadlock-breaking move when he passed hard upfield to Pears, who worked a swift and unselfish interplay with the advancing Garrett to draw the defence out of position.  The captain took full advantage and slotted the ball home neatly to snap a seven-game goalless streak with his second of the league season on 13 minutes.
Peterborough quickly got a slap hit into the South D and a reversed shot from the penalty spot looked as though it might spell danger but Steve Parker stayed cool, faced the striker down and kicked out to safety.  Despite a lack of concerted possession, South always had the pace to threaten and Tristen Knight's pass to Chris Baker was soon whipped on to Pears, who set Johnson free at close range.  The South winger, with his customary bravery, took the keeper on man-to-man but ended up on the deck as a sliding clearance took his legs and the ball from under him.  Graveling and Leo Tomita, a welcome addition, triggered another attack into the D but Peterborough slowly shifted the balance despite Garrett's hard work and some thoughtful interventions by Knight.  Morgan, who had one of his best games in South colours, handled a tricky situation in the bottom corner with studied coolness, reversing upfield under pressure, while Oren, the doughty Jim Thorpe and Graveling all had to be on their mettle, Thorpe twice halting Peterborough surges and returning the ball with interest and Graveling doing one of his speciality postage-stamp escape manoeuvres while surrounded by a gaggle of attackers.
The home side then took advantage of a controversial free hit resulting from an aerial and forged a way through to the circle, where an unmarked man got in a good position to reverse.  Parker covered impressively, however, blocking the shot in an advanced position and diving back to his post as the ball was shepherded to safety.  He was quickly out again to kick clear as a deflection was tipped in and, after Knight had just missed the target following a swift build-up involving Garrett and the terrier-like Pears, the action focused once more on the South back line as Morgan, Oren and Thorpe all worked overtime to keep things in hand.  Peterborough were justifiably awarded their second short corner after a tackle from the wrong side and their specialist striker, for some reason not occupying his usual slot two teams and a division higher, crashed the ball in hard, Parker doing well to get a piece of it.  The umpires awarded the goal after consulting but, to this correspondent at least, the ball always appeared to be appreciably above backboard height and should therefore have been ruled out.
A clumsy tackle under pressure gave the home side their third short just before the break but, this time, the injection was substandard and Thorpe seized on the aftermath to clear with confidence.  Knight's fine pass to Pears nearly resulted in a South reply but, after a late fast break up the right involving Johnson, Baker and Garrett, the half ended all square.
On the resumption, Garrett carried on where he had left off, stealing the ball in midfield and laying it off to Baker, whose speedy and uncomplicated distribution served South well throughout the game.  But Peterborough attacked with renewed vigour, and Morgan twice had to put in superbly-timed tackles to keep them at bay.  Garrett also lent much-needed assistance as Baker was pounced on by footpads and Graveling required all his skill to extricate himself single-handedly from the mob.  Garrett's pace relieved the pressure momentarily, though his long run with men in support was terminated by a missed pass, and further progress was made when Johnson latched on to Thorpe's through ball and beat four men before channelling on to Baker and Pears.  Tomita made a big win in midfield before Peterborough sliced across the face of goal and were awarded a short after South were harshly penalised for lifting the ball when no other players were in the vicinity.  Fortunately, Parker read the slip and flick and was in just the right position to make a left pad save which was then neatly cleared.  Thorpe, reacting to the tight marking at sixteens, summoned up the heavy artillery to good effect but Baker also made himself intelligently available for a shorter route.  South had to work extremely hard out of defence at this point, with Garrett neding to beat four men on his own 25 just to hang on to possession, and even Thorpe made a late pitch for Strictly with some deft footwork to round three opponents moments after delivering a blockbuster tackle.  Knight also displayed a stiff upper lip when contesting several 50-50 balls up front, while Morgan continued his fine performance with a resounding challenge in the left corner.
There were occasional chances at the other end, however, and Baker and Knight interpassed smoothly to give Pears an opportunity but time ran out on him and the ball was whisked upfield, where a deflection off a defensive stick released a home attacker into the circle.  Thankfully, Parker rapidly closed him down, blocking the shot on the ground and then driving play wide to stop any follow-up.  There was little respite, though, as Peterborough were awarded a fifth penalty corner, from which they overcame a fudged stop to return the ball to the D, move it right and then shoot at an angle towards the far corner.  But, in a vital passage, Parker dived full-length to his right to make a great stick save and, as the ball hovered for what seemed like hours in front of an attacking stick, he knocked it out of reach at the key moment and South breathed again.  The home side soon bore down again inexorably on the penalty spot and, this time, Morgan and Thorpe were on hand to funnel it out with measured sang froid.  
After Pears, Garrett and Baker had combined to get a shot on the Peterborough goal (saved at the left post), South won their first and only short after 55 minutes.  A strike from Baker after a slip by Garrett was deflected for a long and, in the ensuing push goalwards, Garrett raked across the D, drew the keeper to his left and rattled home into the far corner to put South back into the lead.  South consolidated at this stage, with exemplary tackling from Graveling and Thorpe, neat control from Baker and sensible distribution from Tomita.  Knight got stuck in on the left wing, too, and another chance was manufactured via the Baker-Johnson-Pears axis, this time a reverse from Pears which may just have skimmed the keeper's left post but which nevertheless drew a good stretch save.  With the momentum in their favour, South pressed hard and, after nuggety work from Pears in the D, Knight did well to get in front of the keeper and stick the ball home from what was for him uncharacteristically close range.
Though this goal, scored after 60 minutes, gave South a welcome cushion, Peterborough were nothing daunted and won a sixth short when Garrett prostrated himself on the byline in stopping a dangerous attack near the post.  The resulting strike, which had both weight and dip as expected, was confidently blocked by Parker, who then sticked it out of harm's way himself.  A counter-attack featuring Thorpe, Oren and Baker nearly succeeded in getting Johnson into the thick of the home D but Peterborough were soon back, Morgan composedly tackling in the right corner, Tomita rescuing Baker from a further mugging and Thorpe and Garrett struggling to break the shackles on the left.  With four minutes to go, Peterborough won their seventh short as South were forced to hit out under pressure and, although Parker again saved a rocket of a direct strike, an attacker was on hand to lift the rebound into the net; even then, it grazed the helmet on the way in.  To their credit, South did not become sicklied o'er and, in spite of a nervy moment which was smoothed over by Tomita's controlled reverse out under strife, it was the visitors who finished marginally stronger. Peterborough were lucky not to concede a short when Johnson was upended in the home 25 and late shots from Baker and Pears had to be beaten out.  Thankfully, the final minutes played out quickly and, with Knight beavering away in safe territory, the welcome whistle sounded.
Though skipper Garrett, who led by example throughout, felt that this was far from being South's best performance of the season, this game was a potential banana skin which the team, through commitment and perseverance, did well to avoid slipping up on.  The home side, very much belying their league position and looking better than their sole victory over Nomads would suggest, were organised, had skilful younger players with a leavening of experienced veterans and possessed serious scoring potential from the set piece.
With the three points from this match, South complete the pre-Christmas schedule in third place, three points behind Wisbech, who have an almost identical record in terms of goals for and against and boast, along with South, the meanest defence in the league.  This third position would in fact have been fourth but a recent League review of an umpiring irregularity in the game between Peterborough V and the University resulted in the Light Blues' victory being overturned and the points awarded to Peterborough.  This circumstance, unfortunate in itself for the side affected, benefits South in some measure and it is important to capitalise on this in the New Year.  After a trip to Deeping on 16 January, South have consecutive games against Wisbech, the University and bogey team Rutland and it is the results of these three key encounters which will ultimately determine the direction of their season.","Men's 1sts beat City of Peterborough 5","False","False",,1,"True","False",

Steve Parker in goal made an early point-blank save from close range but, apart from a few long aerial balls that were skilfully absorbed by Matt Readman in particular, Deeping posed no great threat up front in the first half although they were organised in defence.
Early on, Chris Baker, looking sharp after spells in the gym and the squash courts, beat four men in a row with a feline grace worthy of the Fen Tiger, while Lukas Snetler, with a trademark reverse hit, Mark Pears, Chris Graveling and Garrett all drew good saves from the Deeping keeper, who was overworked but not overwhelmed as South drove forward with intent.  There was an elegant paddle-sweep from Graham McCulloch which would have made a very pretty goal had it not just eluded the left-hand post but, for all the incisive approach work, the finishing left something to be desired.  The four first-half short corners were all smoothly injected and crisply stopped but there was little reward as either the keeper or an adroit defensive stick got in the way.  Baker's attempted flick on the fourth was more pussy than tiger and South's luck was summed up when Keith Hewitt, perhaps over-excited after the long break, agonisingly scuffed the ball onto the keeper's left toe when handed a platinum opportunity by the unselfish Pears.  [Your correspondent writes with the benefit of hindsight that Al Sinclair opened the scoring for South at some point during the first half, an event mysteriously unseen and unrecorded in the notebook but corroborated by several people who obviously had a better view!]
Hewitt nevertheless persisted in his familiar all-action style and, though not finding the goal on this occasion, he had no difficulty in locating the knees of sundry Deeping defenders, which appeared unhappily magnetised to the ball.  South opened up a cushion on 48 minutes when, from a short-corner slip by Hewitt that for once did not involve any intervening Deeping anatomy, Sinclair flicked home into the bottom of the goal via the keeper's stick.  The balance of play remained firmly with South but, on 53 minutes, a Deeping breakaway following a neat aerial left the home defence a man short and an unmarked central striker slotted home with aplomb to wobble the collies.
As time wore on, however, Deeping's straight eleven tired and South's longer bench enabled them to keep throwing fresh players on.  The visitors became increasingly stretched at the back, especially when Russell Johnson found space on the right to cut in ominously, and in the last 15 minutes, South accelerated out of sight with a strike from Chris Graveling (in perfect position to flick home unopposed after a recycled short corner) preceding cool finishes from Snetler and Garrett which exploited all the angles that had started to become available.  James Cobbe was unlucky not to make it six with a sweet first-timer, while a Hewitt-Snetler one-two also nearly did the trick.
The defensive corps were not unduly troubled, with Leo Tomita's slap-hits largely unreadable and Jim Thorpe even jumping into the attack with a booming drive at one point, but slack marking near the end left a lone gun bearing down on goal.  Parker, though, raced out unhesitatingly and picked his moment to despatch ball and man in customary fashion to set the seal on an ultimately convincing victory.
Despite this pleasing start to the post-Christmas campaign, South are well aware that their next three games - against Wisbech (away), the University (home) and Rutland (away) - will be the real litmus test of their ambitions for the season and it is to be hoped that all parts of their game are in good working order for the task that lies ahead.","Men's 1sts shake off the mince pies with an impressive win against  Market Deeping 2","False","False",,1,"True","False",
145,"23/01/2010","League",1,133,"14:30",31,"Away","0","1","0","0","False","False","False","In a tight and nerve-racking game whose result could have been reversed without any undue breach of natural justice, South were unlucky to come away empty-handed after a committed and resilient performance that saw them go agonisingly close to an equaliser in the last five minutes.
A delay in locating appropriate umpiring resources allowed South to shake off their road legs after a wearisome series of roadworks but it was still Wisbech who were quicker out of the traps, drawing a series of fine low blocks from Steve Parker as they pounded into the D from the left.  A very crisp short strike then drew a magnificent diving stick save from the South keeper, who has now played hockey in five decades, and this encouraged a period of stabilisation as the back line gained control and passed with swift composure.  Chris Graveling, together with James Cobbe and debutant Nick Bristowe, made light of the absence of three senior defenders and, though Parker twice had to kick away firmly in the first 15 minutes, firm resolve and equally firm tackling in the South half meant that Wisbech had to work hard to make ground.  Much hilarity ensued when a home midfielder tried the aerial route and landed the ball rather nearer the clubhouse than the pitch but otherwise the battle was tense.  Bristowe and the nippy Graham McCulloch winkled their way neatly out of a maze in the left corner, while skipper Rob Garrett, covering his usual acreage, was back to rescue things on the one occasion the defence was bypassed.
There was little time to be had on the ball and Chris Baker, appreciating the penalties for lingering, put in several quick and subtle through passes.  Strikers Mark Taylor and Mark Pears rammed the accelerator at the appropriate juncture but the parsimonious Wisbech defence allowed them few sniffs and all South really had to show by way of chances in the first stanza was a dangerous cross from Russell Johnson that just squirrelled off Taylor's stick in the D.  Other centring passes were intercepted despite good anticipatory positioning from the forward line and South finished the half in defensive mode as Cobbe reverse-tackled confidently, Al Sinclair combined intelligence with force in comprehensively grounding a Wisbech attacker and Bristowe stepped forward punctually to take a man who hesitated too long when his colleagues were well marked.
Graveling set the tone for the second half with a trademark laser-guided reverse tackle and there were further stout efforts in South's zone from Sinclair and the hard-working Lukas Snetler, whose great positional sense allowed him to largely quell a tricky left-winger.  A twin-barrelled run from Garrett and Pears gave Taylor a micro-opportunity for a shot which hit the keeper but South then wasted a rare short which broke down and led to Baker kissing the turf while trying to muscle back possession.  Snetler cleared from a nasty-looking melee near the front of the D but Wisbech soon won their second short, deservedly scoring when a low flick to a man near the right post was first-timed in as Parker almost got something in the way with a full-length dive.
South were nothing daunted, however, and nearly levelled the scores a minute or so later when a brilliantly mazy run from Garrett ended with a pass which Baker just failed to land in the bullseye.  The hosts were duly warned and, now adding decibels to their solid and forthright approach, re-armed themselves after Johnson delivered a stinging cross that evaded everyone.  There was a flood forward in numbers for a few minutes at this stage but Graveling and Bristowe in particular manned the pumps to stop any breaches in South's defensive wall.  Up front, the killer pass still eluded South despite Garrett's extensive efforts to surge to the fore and, though Taylor did well to fashion a powerful cross after marked thrusts from Pears, Johnson and Snetler, the home keeper interposed himself firmly.  This was after the big striker, making good strides forward, had himself missed connecting with a Johnson centre at the top of the D.
Wisbech continued to attack, however, and Graveling, Bristowe and Cobbe all made key interceptions, whilst Parker dived out hard to intercept a cross bound for the far post.  With five minutes to go, Garrett and Pears manufactured another lung-burster up the left and McCulloch, raking swiftly across the top of the D, was dismayed to see his nicely-timed shot go just wide of goal.  Wisbech's third and final penalty corner, another low flick, was well stopped, whereupon Snetler, McCulloch and Pears worked wonders to get the ball to the other end and win a short.  A great two-way slip via Taylor gave Pears a chance of glory on the injector's post but the ball bounced obstinately off the stick as Wisbech breathed again.  Bristowe, Graveling and the ubiquitous Garrett then turned a late Wisbech raid into a counter-attack, which resulted in Baker committing life and limb to two desperate efforts a couple of yards from goal.  The hosts' keeper came up trumps, though, and was subsequently grateful to see Pears bury a slipped pass from South's third short into the side netting.  The pace became increasingly frantic as the seconds ticked away and, in a late, late bid, Snetler found space to release Sinclair in the D.  The latter's snap shot bounced off the keeper, however, and rolled out of harm's way to condemn South to what on the overall balance of play could reasonably be described as an undeserved defeat.
The two teams, with virtually identical records before the game and having fought out a closely-contested draw earlier in the season, pitted similar strengths against each other again and the result was always going to involve the narrowest of margins.  It could have gone either way but the final bit of luck just escaped South, who nevertheless impressed with strong defence, pacy midfield work and a keen work ethic.  There is still much jockeying for position in the top five or six and possibly not even Spalding are immune from a dogfight.  Next week sees the return fixture against the University in another key encounter, and it would be a great boon for South if they could fashion a repeat of their superb smash-and-grab victory at Wilberforce Rd in October.","Men's 1sts lose 1-0 at Wisbech Town 2","False","False",,1,"True","False",

As it was, however, Rutland ruthlessly exploited tiring legs and put away three neat goals in the final fifteen minutes to secure a victory that seemed as though it might elude them for much of the game.
Acting skipper Keith Hewitt, after a convincing pre-match team talk, duly led by example and almost opened South's account in the first minute when a long flick clanged off the post.  Play continued pretty evenly from that point, with South's defence equal to the attacking threat and Mark Pears, in an unaccustomed midfield role, and Hewitt running hard to create space up front.  Jim Thorpe, Matt Readman and a composed Paul South all made timely interceptions and Manu Bhardwaj impressed at right back with unflustered tackling and some penetrative distribution.  South (C) survived a hairy spell when a misplaced square pass at the back put a home striker in the clear but Steve Parker was on hand to put in a crunching tackle and block the follow-up.  Ron Oren distinguished himself with a fine save as Rutland swarmed to the edge of the circle before South reversed the flow, first winning a short corner and then, following a Bhardwaj slap upfield and a deflection off the keeper, taking a 1-0 lead when debutant Ali Ward dived in from a strategic distance to bury the rebound on 24 minutes.
The remainder of the half was to-and-fro, with Oren winning a green card to match his lovely new shirt and Readman killing several attacks both aerial and ground-based.  South, however, had the better chances and, three minutes before the interval, the Rutland keeper made a trio of saves from Ward, Hewitt and Readman that kept his side in the game.  Ward, lurking potently in the D, also went close with a first-timer from a Hewitt feed and a second goal for South at this stage would have seen them strongly placed for the second period.  It was not to be, however, and South were ultimately grateful for Thorpe's nifty three-point turn to get them out of a nasty hole shortly before the whistle.
The opening exchanges after the break were dominated by the hosts, and poor marking saw South under the cosh for the first five minutes.  Some semblance of control was recovered as Hewitt charged up the middle and James Cobbe dodged three defenders as he made a determined weaving run up the left.  South (P) reverse-tackled effortlessly and Hewitt brought off a couple of steals with his customary persistence but Rutland eventually bullied their way into the D, only being brought up short when Parker formed an impassable obstacle at the near post for Readman to put away to safety.  Two shorts came and went for South (C) as South (P)'s flick was saved by the keeper and a Hewitt slip overran the target, but the chances still came.  Hewitt, putting himself about angularly in the opposition 25, manufactured a good opportunity but failed to get enough wood on a flick and then Ward, who had once more got free in the circle, received an astute through pass from the skipper and first-timed it towards the far corner.  The shot glanced off the keeper as he advanced hopefully and this piece of good fortune was in retrospect the turning point of the match.
Rutland, swapping their wingers frequently and spreading the play out to stretch the defence, now started to look more threatening, running through or banging the ball hard in to the middle, and Parker twice alertly kicked out of danger.  A series of short corners ensued, with Parker again in brilliant form as he batted away a wicked deflection from an awkward height and then made a superb double save, following a diving effort to his right with an even better blocker save from a prone position.  Another short saw him take one just below the euphemisms and clear to safety before Oren and Cobbe won temporary respite.  But the omens were not good and, following on from a seventh short corner, Rutland pulled it back from the line into the centre, where no-one could clear effectively, and punched in the equaliser after 55 minutes.
A further penalty corner was wasted but the home strikers surged in again as Parker spectacularly gloved a rising shot over the back fence.  South fought grimly to wrest back the initiative, with Readman and Bhardwaj steely in defence, Thorpe relieving the pressure by a surprise aerial and Cobbe, Pears and Hewitt striving to escape the shackles in midfield, but Rutland continued to burst through.  A ninth penalty corner won on an unlucky foot just inside the circle led to a low diagonal flick which was expertly tipped in by an unmarked man on the far post.  With five minutes to go, South bravely summoned their remaining reserves and managed despite everything to create two more chances, Paul South benefiting from good tackling and distribution by Oren and Bhardwaj to get forward and test the keeper.  Russell Johnson, too, kept running committedly to the last without an iota of luck.
Rutland had the last word, however, putting the final nail in the coffin with two minutes to go as they again got round the by-line, pulling it back for a textbook tap-in and a two-goal lead.  Even then, Parker still had to make a fine outstretched stick save to prevent a fourth strike.  There was no opportunity to hit back and South had to admit defeat despite a very hard-working effort.
With their victory, Rutland leapfrog South into fifth place (although they have played a game more) and, with all the other top teams winning over the weekend, South are now somewhat off the pace.  Availability problems probably had their effect on this occasion but all credit is due to the bare eleven who played and who, if they had gone 2-0 up with 20 minutes to go, could well have pulled off a famous win against traditionally difficult opponents.","Men's 1sts lost at Rutland after leading at Half Time.","False","False",,1,"True","False",

The scoreline meant that St Ives, instead of pulling up to within two points of South as they would have hoped, are now eight points behind, with South additionally having a game in hand.
South made their intentions plain from the start, with Chris Graveling in overwhelmingly solid form at the back and Al Sinclair forging into the St Ives D with typical directness, and this positive approach was rewarded when Keith Hewitt, following up from his own blocked short-corner strike, mercilessly roofed the ball to put South in the lead after 3 minutes.  St Ives, as ever vocal between themselves, and some punctilious umpiring which saw Sinclair penalised 10 yards for raising a questioning eyebrow contributed to a feverish atmosphere and it all began to look a bit chaotic as the visitors won three penalty corners in quick succession.  Fierce tackling from Matt Readman and Lukas Snetler, a hit wide and the disallowance of a goal from a horrible bobbler all kept the slate clean, however, and after Steve Parker had saved to leave Graveling a clearance, South could at last breathe a little more easily.  St Ives' practice of keeping a couple of loud and energetic forwards high meant the defence could never entirely relax, though, and the presence of Maj-Gen Thorpe, with his powerful artillery and parade-ground staunchness, was perpetually reassuring whenever a calm interception or pragmatic clearance was required.
Russell Johnson and Mark Pears worked a nice one-two in the top right-hand corner to create an opening but the visitors' keeper got down well at the edge of the D and then recovered to deny the follow-up.  Play see-sawed at this stage, with Graveling and Readman having to stay low and mean in the tackle, and South had a let-off as a long angled slip from a short narrowly beat a man running in hard on the post, who was well saved by Parker's left pad.  South were swiftly away upfield, though, with Hewitt and debutant Chris Heron feeding Snetler to give Pears an opportunity.  St Ives then immediately counter-attacked, leaving all but Hewitt in their wake, and the skipper earned full marks for doubling back to cut off the thrust single-handed just inside the home 25.  After Pears had not quite managed to get 100% on a Johnson pass, South increaed their lead when, from their second short corner, Sinclair received a neat slip and flicked it consummately past the keeper as the defence were stranded.
Sinclair and Snetler, who showed terrific commitment to the tackle and chase, then worked some effective moves with James Cobbe, while Pears manoeuvred confidently at the top of the D, backsiding a defender before fudging a reverse.  As the half drew to a close, South were spreading the ball round more coherently, with Leo Tomita threading his trademark passes through the defensive ring and Readman and Rich Morgan building solid progress on the right, and the lead could easily have been increased when Snetler, making use of a turnover in midfield, struck a fast riser to the keeper's right and saw it just shave the post.  Cobbe and Snetler then contrived to draw a save from the keeper and South ended the first 35 minutes on top, although it was noticeable that St Ives continued to hang high for the breakaway even when under pressure at the back.
A long central ball from the visitors had Snetler - recovering his breath after his marked exertions earlier - and Readman fighting hard to stem the tide early in the second half but, after Johnson had nearly intercepted a flat ball in the St Ives defence, Hewitt found himself in space and surged into the D before being halted.  Heron showed his paces with a 30-yard run up the left and Johnson and Snetler interpassed rapidly, yet St Ives bided their time and, on 42 minutes, won a short corner.  Parker made an excellent block from a crisp strike but the ball squirrelled out of reach and one of the St Ives forwards snuck through to the bye-line despite attention, finally pulling the ball back for a short pass which was tapped in with ease.  A whiff of smelling salts was needed and Readman provided the necessary ammonia by chicaning out from the back before Snetler again ragged his way to the edge of the D with the assistance of the committed Sinclair.  An end-to-end spell in which Heron was also stopped in full flight was then terminated by a barrage of short corners when St Ives upped the pressure.  Another weighty block from Parker denied the first whilst the others were dissipated after suboptimal stops, although St Ives continued to buzz menacingly round the D despite clearances from Tomita and Graveling.  After Parker had convincingly kicked a cross out to the side, St Ives forced in again up the back-line and, in a virtual mirror image of their first goal, they broke through for a simple centring pass which put the entire defence out of the equation and was steered home for the equaliser.  
Suddenly, it became clear that South had barely crossed the halfway line for over five minutes and, when they were again penalised 10 yards for what appeared no more than a polite enquiry, backs were to the wall, especially when a ninth penalty corner was conceded.  Fortunately, Parker once more came up with the goods, making a full-length dive to divert a blistering drive away to his right, and this had the necessary effect, galvanising South to hit back with a fast whole-pitch move involving Johnson, Hewitt and Pears, successfully completed when Pears put away a slightly mishit shot which nevertheless exploited the positional advantage his pace and sniper's instinct had given him.  With eight minutes to go, St Ives cranked up the decibels but South had already shifted the momentum and now edged towards domination.  Hewitt emerged suddenly into a clearing at the edge of the D but hesitated momentarily before a plethora of choices, then Sinclair shot at the keeper after a move prompted by Heron.  At the back, Sinclair again and Graveling tricked their way out of pressure before Heron found Pears waiting upfield to hold on to possession, a lead followed by first Cobbe and then Hewitt.  Finally, with two minutes on the clock, a fluid move up the inside right channel culminated in an inch-perfect diagonal pass from Hewitt to Pears, who seized the moment and the space available to reverse a super strike and notch his twelfth league goal of the season.  There were no further alarms and South held firm to complete a gratifying victory.
Despite periods of pressure from St Ives, who are a competent side with several strengths, South maintained their composure, which was most important in the ten rather febrile minutes directly after the first goal, and, when they strung passes together, they looked a real threat going forward.  A staunch performance from the rotating defence completed a good all-round effort after a weather- and availability-interrupted few weeks and, with City of Peterborough IV and Rutland losing at the weekend, South gained a little ground on the top five as well as putting clear water between themselves and St Ives.  Though promotion may no longer be an entirely realistic option, the team will want to finish well and at least equal their previous best position in 3NW, fourth in 2007-8.","Men's 1sts beat St Ives 2","False","False",,1,"True","False",

On a rough count, South manufactured at least a score of reasonable and sometimes gilt-edged scoring opportunities but a combination of their own profligacy and the visitors' dogged resistance drove the game to the wire.
The first 15 minutes mainly belonged to South although March, showing no obvious signs of their 9-0 thrashing at the hands of Spalding last weekend, made occasional enthusiastic forays upfield which Jim Thorpe, with a succession of well-timed interventions, neutralised with aplomb.  Matt Readman and Leo Tomita also got stuck in with some typically uncompromising tackles as South gradually gained the upper hand and tested the March keeper, who saved from Lukas Snetler and Mark Pears and then slid out hard to dispossess Snetler at the edge of the circle.  However, from an unthreatening position on the right, March suddenly broke free and sliced into the D, slotting away neatly after a series of defenders had been nutmegged, wrong-footed or bypassed.   South kept making good progress forward but somehow never quite managed to set up a target man in the right place; skipper Keith Hewitt and Mark Pears both failed to lay a stick on passes into the danger area and Chris Baker, who otherwise got through a good volume of subtle and unflashy work, was blocked in the D and then just missed connecting with a Pears cross.  A swift March break caught South's forwards labouring up front and the home side were once more indebted to Thorpe, who cut out a two-on-one as the action thickened around him.  The half finished with further chances going begging as Pears was twice denied by the March keeper and Al Sinclair flicked across the face of the goal.  Baker and Pears both teed up shots nicely as well but one used a putter and the other scuffed his drive so, all in all, it was a below-par first-half performance by the attack.
After the break, the same pattern persisted, with South, despite too many giveaways, continuing to create good opportunities and then being thwarted by the well-organised March defence.  Pears, admittedly suffering from super-man-flu, stubbed wide when Hewitt and Baker had combined to lay the goal wide open and then Readman, jumping into the play, flicked over the bar with glory in his sights.  Frustration led to some ill-advised crossfield passes that were intercepted (and immediately regretted with robust epithets) and March's well-built playmaker, who shielded the ball effectively, took advantage to surge forward on a number of occasions.  A mazy dribble from Sinclair attracted a fair degree of lumber, leading to a trio of short corners, but these brought no relief either.  Pears was blocked, Sinclair's flick was stopped by a defender and the keeper made an excellent double save to deaden Hewitt's powerful strike and palm away the rebound from Sinclair.  A slip to the left post just eluded Pears, who was then beaten out on the opposite post, and Readman tried an elegant reverse strike which caught the keeper off his line but narrowly failed to beat him as he recovered well to tip it over the bar.  At this stage, Thorpe's whiskers were twitching as he edged forward into the opposition half but March were having none of it and, in fact, they came more into the game themselves as Steve Parker was suddenly called upon to save a booming shot from the edge of the circle, kick decisively to the wing and sweep away with his stick to clear in timely fashion from a lone winger.  March also made a mess of a clear opportunity from a jiggled short corner and South were fortunate when an unmarked forward took a wild and fruitless swipe from close range with only Parker covering.  As time ticked down, South pumped away, the keeper saving two shots from the left and a defender bravely blocking a Snetler thunderer from a penalty corner but, just when it seemed as though all South's efforts would come to naught, a short corner routine finally paid dividends and a neat slip from Hewitt via Baker released Readman who, exploiting the space perfectly, calmly picked his spot and rammed it home into the bottom corner for the long-awaited equaliser.  Little further action ensued and, on South's part, there was by this time perhaps more relief at a point saved than disappointment at two lost.
Despite the consistent territorial advantage enjoyed by South, March never resorted to pure defence and South's rearguard of Readman and Thorpe, complemented by sensible contributions from Tomita, Ron Oren and Ian Glover, had to work hard to make sure that the visitors' lead was never increased to irrecoverable proportions.  Nevertheless, South should have won easily despite the assorted scuffs, fluffs and muffs and it is partly this lack of goal-scoring bite (10 goals in the last 7 games compared to 36 in the first 13), allied to midfield and defensive unavailabilities, that has seen them slip down the table.  
Following Sunday's defeat against the University, South have two games left in which to improve their placing.  They are three points behind Peterborough IV, having played a game more, and must face champions Spalding, who narrowly edged them out before Christmas, and Peterborough IV, who lost by a large margin to the University on Saturday but are a very capable side, in their final two games.  Peterborough have Nomads and Rutland to play (apart from South) so South will have a tricky task to climb to fifth.  It would be good to end the season with the right kind of bang.","Men's 1sts draw with March Town 2","False","False",,1,"True","False",
153,"20/03/2010","League",1,114,"14:00",28,"Away","2","6","0","4","False","False","False","Faced with a Spalding side determined to finish top of the league and having to field a somewhat diluted defensive corps themselves, South could perhaps be forgiven for wondering whether a reversal of the pre-Christmas result between the sides - a 2-1 victory to Spalding - was really on the cards and, indeed, after the first 20 minutes, the home side seemed to hold all the aces as they had already cruised into a 4-0 lead thanks to some ruthless finishing.  Exploiting space at South's rear and running hard, they created several gilt-edged opportunities and unhesitatingly put them away with a compelling blend of power and accuracy.  Though South struggled to match the pace, the evergreen Rob Barton, on his seasonal debut for the team, used all his experience to test the hosts' keeper on several occasions during this period and was unlucky to come away empty-handed.
After enduring the early onslaught, South recovered some of their equilibrium, with Rob Garrett as ever working like a Trojan in midfield and elsewhere and Lukas Snetler and Chris Heron making as much use of Ron Oren's feeds from left defence as they were allowed.  Keith Hewitt helped to man the pumps, James Cobbe made a splendid interception on a fast two-on-one break and Steve Parker, given little chance earlier in the half, made a good diving stick tackle as Spalding bore in on the li-ne as the interval approached.
A much more coherent start to the second stanza saw Spalding less dominant, if not entirely on the back foot, and, after Leo Tomita had cleared one of the home side's long biffs in, Heron was brutally upended to earn South a short corner.  Hewitt's strike was not cleared and Chris Baker's instant follow-up was not buried but Garrett formed a one-man third wave and lifted it home in textbook fashion.  The defence and midfield had more concerted possession for a while and Hewitt, Snetler and Garrett, supported by Baker's silky skills<sup><small>TM</small></sup>, all posed a threat going forward.  After Parker had made a great short-range block on the doorstep, Spalding were lured into a couple of unwise passes, one of them well intercepted by Heron, and Hewitt took up the baton, forcing another short corner as the keeper cleared high.  From this, the popular Aussie, playing his final game for South, sent a little ripper (you'll have to imagine the accent) right into the bottom corner to give the hosts a wake-up call ... which sadly they heeded, as less than a couple of minutes later they forged down the pitch and unleashed a snapshot into the opposite corner to make it 5-2.
South remustered and, after Tomita had wisely decided that heading the ball was not a trick worth repeating, Hewitt sent a fair dinkum pass (see, it's rubbing off) across the face of a largely untenanted D, where Russell Johnson, having got his skates on, was just beaten to the action by the advancing keeper.  There was no let-up from Spalding in the physical stakes and the earth shook as Hewitt and the home side's big playmaker, neither candidates for the shrinking violet award, made sudden and close acquaintance with the turf.  South stuck to their guns, with Garrett predatory in the chase and tackle, Cobbe feeding Johnson up the right and Oren sending an incisive diagonal ball through to Snetler, and a fifth short was gained.  Hewitt's bonzer shot rebounded off the keeper and South kept the ball in action through Oren and Baker but Spalding ended the stronger, forcing two fine stops from Parker before creaming in an unstoppable short corner to restore the four-goal margin.  There was still time for a shot past Spalding's left post, a fine interplay between Barton and the other forwards and a bit more argy-bargy to test the umpires but, in the end, South could have no complaints as the hosts' superior firepower won the day and, with it, the league title and a promotion which had in truth seemed likely from the early stages of the season.","Men's 1sts beaten by Division leaders Spalding 1","False","False",,1,"True","False",

Animosity clouded the warm-up with Alice and Tash locked in a bitter battle for the title of Goal Queen.  Ellie lost the toss meaning South started on the back foot as Newmarket went out strong and forced a scrabbling defence to wake up quickly as the home goal was threatened.  This set the stage for what was, frankly, a lazy and complacent performance from the South defenders, with keeper Loopy barely moving a muscle to help the team all match. 
Continuing the theme for this season, South started slowly, keeping the ball away from the opposition but goals were slow to follow.  Lazy midfield play meant the forwards had to do all the work on goal and meant a mere 4 were scored in the first half.  Despite her teammates helping out by getting in some pre-emptive blows, Georgie wimped out of finishing her 'debate' over the rules of obstruction with the substantial Newmarket central defender.  We forgave her a when she scored at last off a short corner, but hope for more moral fortitude in future.  
In the second half, the dominant feature of the game was astoundingly selfish play from Kendra who stole ball after ball and landed them in the back of net in a determined effort to thwart Alice's quest for the goal crown.  Convenient (suspiciously so: should we be examining for corruption?) for Tash, who was able to appear laid back about her own title hunt and landed a mere 4 goals.  Alice seemed somewhat upset about the success of Kendra's haunting of the goal line, but senior voices in the team were heard to comment that if she'd followed instructions to stay high, she'd have had more than a modest 3 extra on her tally.  
So, work to be done all around and South will need to pull their socks up to win more convincingly than 14-0 next week.  The Man of the Match award was grudgingly awarded to Kendra and the Lemon of the Match award goes to John Benedikz who 'kindly' came along to referee then lost count, almost certainly diddling us out of a potentially crucial 15th goal.","Ladies' 1sts just scrape past Newmarket - winning 14:0!","False","False",,1,"True","False",

An early setback came in the form of a early goal gifted to the opposition, but South were soon putting pressure on at the other end as Chris Graveling nearly converted a short corner.  The scores were levelled shortly after as Paul Spiers converted another short corner after some good build up play had led to the set piece.  In a rare loss of concentration, South allowed a Perse forward to escape the notice of the defence.  He restored the lead to leave South 2-1 down at half time.
 
The second half saw South draw level through a well-finished goal from Spiers slotting home past the advancing Perse keeper.  South defended resolutely for a spell and did a good job of protecting Steve Parker's goal as Tom South and James Cobbe made some good leads up front, continually harrying the Perse defence.  Jim Thorpe's mazy run along the right-hand board nearly brought a goal for Cobbe.  Soon enough South took the lead for the first time; the Perse forwards hesitated and as Spiers led the centre away with him, Rich Morgan was able to cut inside from right back to send the ball straight through the middle to Paul South.  His quick turn bought him half a yard of space to finish low to the keeper's left.
 
South can be pleased with a winning start to the season and next face the 18a team, who are likely to prove very tough opposition.

Steve Parker went the right way but Ely City 1sts player Joel Gilmour's flick flew just above him as he dived to his right.
As half time approached, South did have their chances, the best coming from a pass into the D from Jim Thorpe that James Cobbe defelected just wide of the post.  Chris Massey worked tirelessly in the centre and a few of his runs were brought to a premature end as he entered the D.  Sadly South's short corners did not have the same bite as those that Wild Oats had up their sleeve.
By half time the score was 2-0 as Joel Gilmour and Ipswich 1st XI striker Sean Gilmour combined to create the easiest of tap-ins at the far post for Ely youngster Euan Gilmour to score.
Though South talked confidently of getting higher up the pitch and stretching the play wide in the second half, that did not really happen, in spite of a fine piece of opportunism by Paul South, reducing the deficit by tucking the ball past the oncoming keeper after a bit of pinball hockey in the D.
South began to leak short corners and were being punished. Gilmour (J) struck the crossbar and two more shot past Morgan on the far post with great accuracy.  In all honesty the second half display lacked penetration and despite facing some tough opposition in the last two outings, South are going to have to step up a gear if last seasons achievements are to be repeated.","Indoor Team find it tough going against top class opposition.","False","False",45,1,"True","False",

Having seen Shabaz make some good early saves at his near post from Tom Hickson's dangerous flicks at penalty corners, South conceded a fairly soft opener as players were sucked towards the ball leaving a simple overload.  James Cobbe and Manu Bhardwaj then combined well in the middle of the pitch and created a chance that James Featherstone nearly got to, but as was a feature of the first half the final pass kept eluding the attackers' lead runs. By half-time scores were level though as Dan Cross took the ball past two players before calmly slotting the ball into the bottom corner low to the left of the advancing keeper.  Indecision at the top of the D from a series of short coners was typical of the way South had not quite clicked in the first half.
South fell behind again early in the second half to a slick short corner that went between the two defenders on the line.  But minutes later, Cross stayed calm in the D again to finish in spectacular fashion by lobbing the keeper with a perfectly placed flick.  It will take something spectacular to prevent that from being goal of the season.
With the wind in their sails, South pushed forward more and Jim Thorpe's clever ball left Rich Morgan in space but he could only find the put the ball into the side netting of the keeper's pad.  Soon though a lead from Paul South was spotted by Dan Cross  and Paul's precision ball angled back into the D found Morgan attacking the near post.  A sharp turn gave the room for a low shot through the keeper's legs. As players tired on both teams the game became a very open affair and South had a goal disallowed as James Cobbe's shot was adjudged to have been slotted home as the ball was still in the air.  With South trying to press the game high up North and South stole the ball and quickly countered, with Harry Bell moving the ball wide to the left of the onrushing Shabaz before sliding it in for a well-taken equaliser.

Whilst South were able to have some good attacks they couldn't convert.
The second half was more lopsided in terms of play with Saffron Walden having the majority of the pressure and only a few odd breaks from South. Despite this the defence was resolute and it rewarded with a clean sheet for half until Walden finally managed to score with 3 seconds left in the game.

In the centre of midfield, Ian Evans and Martin Grove, who was playing higher up the pitch that usual, both saw plenty of ball and succeeded in distributing it to good effect.  South were using both wings efficiently to manufacture chances, notably via John Clarke, Jake and Shahzad.  The side, although missing it's regular captain of Ky Ho, was nonetheless looking balanced and working well.  So it was no surprise when the breakthrough came midway through the first half.  The opening goal started from an attack up the right hand side featuring John Sharp and Theo Haines, and saw South drive to the backline and pull the ball back past the keeper for Shahzad Ali to forcefully sweep the ball home in trademark fashion.  A second South goal followed just a minute before the half time whistle came when Martin Grove played a quick free hit into Rob Barton who made no mistake in striking low into the corner.  South were in the ascendancy before the break.The second period began as a much more even affair with chances limited, though it wasn't long before Rutland found space and were able to apply pressure to their host's goal.  On a few occasions the young opposition broke through into the South D, but Tim Dean in goal made a number of solid saves from close range to deny on-target shots.  Eventually, a skilful Rutland midfielder found the back board with a confident reverse stick strike from the left of the South D.  After that, the South defence once more managed to take control of their 25 and, although the opposition put up quite a challenge in the middle of the pitch, both sides were limited to only a handful of further half chances.  Rutland worked hard to the very end and, perhaps deserved a better result, but ultimately South hung on fairly comfortably to the marginal victory.This game saw competitive debuts for John Clarke and Theo Haines who both fitted naturally into the side and contributed extremely well.

The first half was one of tidal shifts with the Zeds starting with most of the pressure but not managing to get into the D to take a shot as the defence of Ellie, Lou and Ian, expertly marshalled by Ron kept them at bay, whilst Rob was able to pick the pocket of their dangerous looking midfielders and set up attacks with Georgie linking well, along with some darts from Wilco. Slowly things began to shift and South more pressure and were unlucky not to score after a couple of mazy runs from Rob as his pull backs couldn't quite be pushed in by James or Julie or were saved on the line. Meanwhile Zeds won a short corner from an attack on the break and got the ball in the net only to see it ruled out for not leaving the D. South's one short of the half was unlucky not to produce a goal as Alice's straight strike beat the keeper only to be saved by a defender on the post.
In the last ten minutes of the half though it all went wrong. First when one of the Zeds midfields managed to get free on the break and despite being pushed wide angled his shot just inside the near post.
Two more followed as Zeds managed to get in first to follow up on good saves from Phil.
South turned round 3-0 down feeling harshly treated by the scoreboard and looking for an early goal. A slightly rejigged defense pairing JB and Ron as centre backs, and a tweaked forward line to try to convert more chances with three up front. The tale of the half was one of reasonable Zeds pressure without much penetration into the South D and South hitting back on the break, Rhi, Rob and Hayley combining well down the left wing, and Alice cutting through the defence with some raking balls into the corners for the wingers.
Eventually Zeds managed to break the deadlock scoring from a short.
This spurred South on and although late in the day there was a flurry of attacks. Rewarded when Rob picked up a misdirected Zeds clearance, charged into the D and slipped to James to slot home from the penalty spot under a despairing goal keeper. Whilst Premier League strikers will dash to the corner flag before diving in celebration, James was content to collapse where he was with a cry of relief/surprise. A second followed shortly afterwards with an attack touched by every forward on the South side as the ball was battled inch by inch in from the edge of the D before squeaking through the goalie's pads allowing Rob to reach round and prod home.","Mixed Team lose a well-balanced game against Blue Green Zeds","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Sympathetic umpires Rich Morgan and John Benedikz helped out with all those confusing new rules as necessary but there was no need for explanation when top whistler Steve Riches, miraculously reborn as a left back, got a solid foot on the ball a way that everyone would have recognised from 20 years ago on grass.
Once the odour of liniment had settled, the game was played at an entertainingly quick pace and there was plenty of skill on view on both sides, from old and older alike.  Mark Pears, inveigled to appear for his old club, gave Newmarket the lead after ten minutes with a fine reverse shot into the top corner but a swift interpassing move featuring Rob Barton - who one day will surely fulfil his ambition of playing and scoring for all the club's teams within a 24-hour time-slot - and a dynamic David Bridge was then delightfully topped off by Richard Bettison for a deserved equaliser.  Steve Fleck, feisty and labyrinthine as ever, had a shot stopped on the line and there was much committed to-ing and fro-ing in midfield, with Matt Readman, in tune with the secret of eternal youth, finally locating that overdrive gear he's been looking for for years.
South's back line of Riches and Pride (only two of the deadly sins boasted by South's experienced and multifarious side) hit some cracking drives off the tee whilst occasionally teasing the forwards with a saucy air shot and Kevin, aided by the cast, made sure there was no shortage of witty and laconic encouragement to distant parts of the team.  Meanwhile, Roger Craigen and Keith Davidson continued to display extreme savoir faire on their respective sides of the pitch and their contributions were elegant and measured, even when they didn't have the ball.
Rob Barton, tipped on by Richard, then put South in the lead after 20 minutes, while David Bridge knocked one just wide after a silky cruise by Matt.  It was clear, though, that Newmarket had some swift and suspiciously young(ish) looking chaps at the business end and Steve Parker in goal had had to play a blinder to keep the score down, using all parts of his equipment / anatomy / magnetic field / clairvoyant powers to repel boarders.  Newmarket levelled just before half-time as South's attention wandered at the prospect of a quick smoke, a dose of the ""old git spray"" (clearly a favourite Bettison standby) or just a nice sit down.  God, thirty-five minutes is a long time, isn't it?
Oh no, we have to do it all over again, and uphill this time!!  Service was resumed with a smile and a stubbed-out cig and, thus refreshed, South tackled their Everest with good grace.  The two Steves, Parker and Fleck - resuming a playing partnership from the early 80s (get some in, cried the real veterans) - were in fine form at either end of the pitch and David Bridge brought the house down with the old Coldham's Common party trick of pretending to forget which was the touchline.  Tactfully, Johnny B let him dribble for a few yards to milk the applause.  After a superb run by gas-guzzler Readman, Newmarket scored a rather classy goal to edge in front and, at this stage, I regret your correspondent was given another posting, which means that I only have it on hearsay that a further two goals were conceded (shame!) as lunchtime at the boozer began to dominate thoughts.
In conclusion, it seemed to the watching millions that a damned fine time had been had by all, with a good competitive game having been played in friendly spirit, and it was only a pity that impresario Jim Thorpe, who had assembled this dream line-up and done all the organising, was unable to lend his unique and bonhomous talents to the occasion.

Nomads came out of the blocks fastest and for a while, despite the clamouring from a mass of side line supporters, South were pegged back in their own twenty-five. It took a determined drive out of defence from Hayley to take South out of their own half and provide forwards Alice and Tash with their first chance to threaten. 
The game settled down to a hard fought midfield battle with neither team really able to fashion clear cut chances. Julie and Ellie both cut out some dangerous Nomads forays and Kirsten, Alice and Tash had good runs that couldn't quite be converted. 
The deadlock finally broke a few minutes before half time when a through ball from Kirsten found AI who had ghosted behind the Nomads defence to be unmarked in plenty of space on the penalty spot and duly dispatched the ball with some power into the bottom right corner past a helpless keeper.
Nomads charged back down the pitch and immediately won a short corner but the defence held firm. Despite continued pressure from Nomads half-time came with a 1-0 score line.
The second half started more brightly for South as they had a number of dangerous breaks and Kirsten came very close to doubling the lead only to see her shot graze the wrong side of the post with the keeper beaten. Shortly after they did score from a short corner Kirsten shot at left post and Kendra slipped across the line to deflect it into the right hand corner.
The lead seemed to settle the nerves and South began to play their best hockey with Catherine and Hayley beginning to run the midfield and Rhi making a couple of  dangerous overlaps down the left hand wing. But as the midday heat began to tell Nomads fought back and keeper Loopy had to make a sharp diving saving to her right (followed by a bow to the cheering spectators). 
South had some dangerous breaks with Kendra and Liles but towards the end it was a defensive struggle for South with Kathryn in particular making some great tackles.  The game ended on one of the South breaks though as a short corner was given for a foot in the circle as the time expired to the delight of the traveling throng of side line supports. Despite three attempts South couldn't add a gloss to the score line leaving the game as a 2-0 victory and a season's record of 20 games, 19 wins, 1 loss outscoring opponents by 80 goals to 7.

South began the match determined to finish the season on a high, with the central midfielders spraying passes out to Rowland and Leigh on the left and right wings.   The makeshift defence of Aston, Glover, Bristowe and Agrawala were held firm in the opening minutes, before a strong shot from the Spalding attacker nipped under the keeper's despairing dive to give the home team the lead.
Soon after, another Spalding attack led to a home short corner.   Despite the intitial shot being charged down, the rebound was flicked goalwards, and unfortunately stuck the foot of defender Ian Glover - giving the home team a flick.   Ben Buckley's flirting looks towards the Spalding attacker did not give the same desired effect as the previous weeks against Horncastle, and Spalding went into the break two up.
South re-emerged after the interval determined to have a positive end to the season.   Suddenly, the midfield quartet were linking up well with the strikers, and the defence appeared more confident in dealing with the opposition attacks, with Ben Buckley on fine form to thwart any moves which did get through the back four.
Unfortunately, midway through the second half, South were undone by two defensive errors.   The first - a delayed clearance following a Spalding short enabled the attacker to lift the ball into the unguarded net, and the second, a wayward pass in defence was picked off by the centre forward who calmly slotted past the keeper.   This was not in keeping with the season for the defence, who have excelled this year and have been key to the strong finishing position of 5th in the league.
Despite one or two promising openings up the other end and a few thwarted short corners, the game finished 4-0 to the opposition which flattered them somewhat.   This however, fails to take away from a great season from the Men's 2's, who have defied expectation in finishing as high up the league as they have.

The St Ives defenders deserved credit for their hard work fielding many attacks on the D.  
 The half time jelly babies seemed to do good work and the team went out with a new sense of purpose.  Maintaining composed passing play into the circle was the key.  First off, Breeshey stole the ball in midfield and made a penetrating run to the top of the D before offloading with a deadly accurate pass to Alice who, lurking on the back post, was able to slot the ball smartly behind the keeper.  Goal two was less elegant, but once again Alice had the reflexes to clinch it after some frantic defending from St Ives.  Soon after, Breeshey was instrumental once again, picking out Tash in the circle who slotted the ball to Alice to finish in style.

Whilst South needed a win to guarantee promotion as champions, Market Deeping were fighting to avoid relegation. With half the team at the wrong pitch and the other half discovering Astroturf sun bathing, preparations for the game were perhaps more relaxed than usual but South soon got into a few drills to shake off the sunshine-induced lethargy. South were strong from the off, regaining possession from the push back to put pressure on a resilient Deeping defence. The penalty corner practice on Tuesday was evident as Hayley and George exchanged gloves. A straight strike to the right post saw Tash poke the ball in (much to Alice's dislike - 1 goal in it now I think). All the pressure was from South, with Loopy not having a kick in the first half. South were rewarded with multiple penalty corners and Alice had a great shot, flying into the roof of the net, saved by the keeper. The sustained pressure resulted in a Deeping defender stopping the ball cross the line with her foot. Penalty flick. Luckily Alice and Hayley had been practicing in the warm up. Hayley stepped up and placed it low into the left corner. In the dying seconds of the first half South were again rewarded with a penalty corner, this time a straight strike from Hayley deflected into the bottom right corner off a defender's foot. 3-0 up at half time.
The sun beat down and players were getting tired. South worked the ball well with the midfield linking up with one-twos around the defence. Alice came close to adding to her tally on a number of occasions but it wasn't to be her day as the one that crossed the line was disallowed for back-stick. 
Liles was tenacious in defence giving the Deeping midfield little time on the ball, with Kirsten picking up the loose balls on the left and driving at the Deeping defence.

The match began brightly for South, with the midfield quartet creating a number of promising openings, and new forward Will Jones linked up promisingly with John Hawkes and Rob Barton.   Wingers Bhav Virdee and Kev Rowland were firing in some decent crosses from either side, but the March defence held firm.
Up the other end, March were always committing many bodies forward in search of the opening goal.   George Wych in particular along with the rest of the defence were largely keeping the March attack at bay, until a fired in cross from the left was placed over Ben Buckley's dive at the second attempt.
Unperturbed, South poured forward, and won a fair number of short corners.   One of these led to the equaliser- John Hawkes cleverly lifting the ball over the outstretched keeper following an original save from a Nick Bristowe shot.
After half time, it was clear the game was going to become stretched as both teams' midfields committed forward to attacks and struggled to track back, as a result of the previous day's (and Friday night's!) excursions.   South to their credit fired some more dangerous crosses into the D, and had one glorious one o one opportunity.   March were held at bay by the excellent tackling from Wych & co.
However, on one attack down the right midway through the half, March found the breakthrough.   A pass was cut back from the byline and the March attacker pushed the ball firmly past the keeper's right.
This pressed the South into action again, and the attack poured forward.   However, despite numerous promising openings, South could not find the equaliser their play deserved, and suffered their second consecutive defeat in two days, and with it, any final lingering hopes of promotion.   This fails to take the gloss off a very promising season however (which began with safety as the objective), and three good performances in the last three games should see them finish the season strongly, hopefully in the dizzy heights of 4th place.","Men's 2nds lose to March Town 2","False","False",,1,"True","False",

The first half was relatively even, particularly when the March playmaker number 18 was off the pitch after various verbal and physical misdemeanours had tried the patience of the umpire once too often. CSouth kept calm in the face of much provocation and overly aggressive opponents, and were able to put together good attacking moves using the wings and centre of the pitch well, and supporting one another effectively. Half chances were created, a goal proved elusive. That number 18 was being well marked by Tristan Knight, which constrained CSouths attacking options, but kept us in the game.  
In the second half the younger, fitter, faster, more skillful, angrier, quicker thinking March team, obviously used to a higher league, got the ascendancy. The home defence of BenedikzSneadePassmoreLeeSouth, stood firm notably with many thumping clearances from JB and diving tackles from Andy P, until the fateful moment as John Greaves was realing at the top of the D from a whack on the thigh (that man number 18 again). Most players stopped, expecting a whistle, except for a couple of March forwards who combined to scramble the ball over the line.  
CSouth did get the ball into the net via a Lewis rasper, but above the back board from a short corner. Other chances from Creed and South went close, and Shabhaz kept the March hordes out with some effective blocks and saves
It was clear that March really needed this result and had brought along a team to get it. 
Tea at the Earl of Derby was good as always  
The CSouth thirds again played well, and demonstrated that much progress has been made since the previous season, our first in 5NW, but could only hold out against superior opponents for so long on this occasion.

Deeping pulled a goal back, as they unpicked the defensive line with neat interplay from a well worked short corner routine
That was the story of the second half. Sadly this came after a not so fine first half.

After a bright start, the home side deservedly opened the scoring when a misplaced pass in the South defence allowed the Stevenage centre forward to break into the circle. Defenders scrambling back to cover only succeeded in obscuring keeper Jim Sutcliffe's view of an accurate shot at the corner of his goal, giving him no chance.
South were back on level terms within a couple of minutes when centre forward Will Marston slipped a short corner to Stephen Fleck, who made room for himself and struck a clean drive, which Hannes Roux touched home by the left post.
Using that frenetic start as a springboard, South put together some dangerous attacks. However with the team now pushing forward, quick counter-attacks saw them occasionally outnumbered in their defensive zone. When one of these produced a short corner, Stevenage retook the lead with another well placed shot into the corner.
Ignoring the setback, South dominated the rest of the half. The central midfield pairing of Fleck and Roux were distributing the ball well to the club debutant wide players Tom Harrison and James Pope. One such flowing move, which had started all the way back in South's defensive zone with right back Mark Jackson, produced the second equaliser. The other club debutant of the day, Shantanu Golaz, picked up the rebound from Marston's saved shot and showed excellent composure in neatly flicking the ball home.
South moved ahead for the first time soon afterwards, when another attack down the right wing saw Golaz sweep a spinning shot goalwards from near the penalty spot. On bouncing the ball leg-broke in a manner Shane Warne would have been proud of, giving the Stevenage keeper little chance. South nearly made it four to complete an excellent first half, when Marston broke into the box and lifted a shot over the prone goalkeeper, only for a Stevenage defender to make an excellent knee-high goal-line clearance.
At the start of the second half the game settled into an end-to-end pattern with both teams defenders and keepers being kept busy, Sutcliffe in particularly making one excellent stretching save with his right leg as another shot was arrowing at the corner of his net.
As the match wore on the effects of being a man light began to tell on South and despite strong performances by defenders Paul McIlwaine and Jan Brynjolffssen, a potential victory slipped to defeat in the last ten minutes. First a good move down the Stevenage right saw a man worked free in the box, and he slipped the ball under Sutcliffe to equalise. Then with less than two minutes to go, a short corner was flicked onto the post and rebounded to a waiting forward, who made no mistake from close range.
South did have a final chance to get the draw their performance warranted, with a short corner given seconds before the final whistle. With the match over as soon as the corner was completed, Fleck's flicked shot just cleared the crossbar.
Good performances from everyone, especially the new players to the club. Well played, and do keep coming back for more. However the man-of-the-match was, um, apparently Jan Brynjolffssen (or me).

Short of several players, as usual, South had drafted a guest right winger and Keith Simpson started his first match for the 1st team. It won't be his last as Keith did an excellent job in defence with Jim Thorpe and Johnny Tostevin. Johnny T worked well going forward, linking up in particular with Chris Massey, making his debut in the outdoor game.
Rick Erlebach and Chris Graveling both played well in central midfield, supported by Rob Hay on the left. Up front, guest player Seigo showed a useful turn of pace and Sanjay Argawala and Matt Murray both looked dangerous going forward.
Super-sub Dan Addlinton came on to give a variety of players a breather and demonstrated why he's a valued player in the 2nd XI. Rob Hay got the first goal, profiting from a goal mouth scramble and Chris Graveling slotted the second from a well worked short corner.

South started slowly and Blueharts deservedly took the lead after five minutes as the team attempted to gel together. South failed to pick up a long pass into their box and in the resulting confusion the ball was bundled into the back of the net, leaving keeper Mubashir Niaz stranded.
The goal jump-started South who then surged forward in search of an equaliser. As South kept pushing forward, driven well by centre half Tom Harrison, they created more and more chances. Then, after another strike on goal appeared to have been cleared away, Jack Chalk picked the ball up on the baseline and struck the ball from an extremely acute angle into the back of the Blueharts net.
Although South looked solid going forward the backline of Andrew Pounce, John Benedikz, debutant John Sharp and a borrowed player looked a little vulnerable and as legs tired towards the end of the half another ball into the box was not picked up and the was duly despatched into the bottom corner of the South goal.
South came out for the second half all guns blazing, pushing Blueharts back well into their own half. Strong passing by David Bridge down the left and a series of long dribbles down the right by James Pope kept Blueharts penned into their own box. Eventually Cambridge South forced a short corner off the foot of a defender. Benedikz pushed the ball out to Chalk who struck to the near post where it was deflected towards goal by Benedikz, only to be cleared for another short corner by a deliberate foot. The same corner routine occurred again only this time the ball was deflected over the line for 2-2.
South pressure continued for most the second half with Chalk and Wilco Dijkstra continuing to be thorns in the side of the Blueharts backline. They created several more chances, the closest being when a trademark Chalk run round the back of the defence could not quite pick out an unmarked Harrison on the penalty spot.
Once again legs tired and the South defence came under some pressure. This time thanks to some fantastic tackles by Sharp and Pounce, Blueharts failed to break through.

South came out of the traps brightly and were one up within three minutes. Good passing up the right hand side followed by a quick switch across the D allowed Rob Hay to finish emphatically from close range for the opener. A stunned Peterborough were further behind less than ten minutes later when another text book attack up the right and firm cross allowed Andy Rose to slam home from close range.
An extended period of South pressure ensued with John Tostevin and Keith Simpson in particular getting forward well to support the attack. Some well executed off the ball movement afforded Rick Erleback the chance to drive forward from midfield and slip the ball to Sanjay Agarwala for a simple far post tap-in. There was even time for a fourth before the break when Andy Rose lifted a sweet reverse flick into the bottom corner for his second.
In the second half Peterborough presented a stiffer challenge and took the opportunity of a lapse of South's concentration to score via an unmarked lone striker after fifty-five minutes. This wake-up call rejuvenated South and was epitomised by a superb Peter Carey run into the D which could only be halted by a blatant trip. Sadly, however, Andy Rose's hat trick was denied as his resulting flick was well saved.
Sanjay Agarwala's constant effort came into fruition when he scored a deserved second this time stemming from the left. Agarwala turned provider for the penultimate goal came when another slick move down the left wing found Rob Sprawson free at the top of the D to strongly smash home. Matt Murray rounded off the goal scoring when Rob Barton picked him out after a well worked team move in the final moments.
South demonstrated they are capable of some neat flowing hockey at times and excellent off the ball movement and committed tackling were prevalent throughout the match.

Fifteen minutes of intense pressure from Market Deeping followed but the defence stood firm and Poole kept them out with at least a dozen point blank saves.

South's ranks were boosted by the inclusion of 1st teamers Rob Barton, Jon Taylor and Jon Tostevin.
From the whistle Spalding were obviously a better organised side and seemed to have a greater hunger for possession. However, this did not daunt the South defence which was led by Andrew Leonard and featured Rob Barton in the unfamiliar position of sweeper. South gave an excellent defensive display throughout the first half and continually frustrated the home side. Andrew Pounce and Daniel Raffle, on either side, made solid tackles and received good support from the midfield, especially David Bridge on the left, showing that defending with the whole team from the front was an effective strategy.
Spalding won a number of penalty corners through the half and, although a number were well struck, they were all cleared by keeper Will Benedikz and the defenders, including one deftly turned around the post by Rob Barton.
Spalding were far from having things their own way and South were constantly on the counter attack. South showed good variety by working the ball both down the wings through David Bridge and Ali Blake, making his first start of the season, and directly through the centre of the pitch via Jameses Bridge and Pope.
Up front, Jon Taylor provided a deep link between the midfield and the ever-active Wilco Dijkstra at centre forward. Jon was instrumental in winning three or four penalty corners for South. These were taken quickly but the Spalding defence were very quick off the line and, like their opponents, managed to prevent a clear chances being created.
The second half started badly for South. A tactical change round brought Jon Tostevin into the defence and pushed Rob Barton back to familiar territory, whilst David Bridge dropped back and swapped with Daniel Raffle at left back. Far from settling the side these changes disrupted things and almost immediately from the restart Spalding took advantage of the disorder to sweep through for their first goal. The second followed minutes later from a well-struck short corner into the bottom right of the goal.
At 2-0 down South were pushing hard for goals. This allowed Spalding the luxury of defending in numbers and counter-attacking when possible. Their keeper played well throughout the game and made a number of good saves to deny the South forwards. Spalding continued to counter attack in numbers on the break and always looked dangerous, forcing Will Benedikz to make a number of saves. Jon Tostevin was required to make at least one tackle after a Spalding player had rounded the keeper.
In the central period of the half further changes to the side, driven by fatigue, left Ali Blake as an isolated centre forward and Wilco Dijkstra dropping almost into the midfield. South began to get back into the game and put up a greater fight for the ball. However, having just one forward meant their options in attack were limited despite good build-up play.
In the final ten minutes South were pushing forward harder and leaving their defence exposed. Spalding took advantage to break in numbers and scored twice more; once in open play and the second from another penalty corner.
At the final whistle the more consistent team had won but South were by no means embarrassed by their solid team performance.
The result was disappointing although much of the play through the game, especially the first half, was very encouraging with the team settling down to work together and defending strongly. The return of a number of players next week will help this and, despite the score, the game is another positive step for the team.
Thanks to those who doubled up and Chris Massey for umpiring.

South started the game confidently and, despite nearly conceding a goal in the fourth minute when the defence was split open by incisive St Ives passing, exerted so much pressure that they won four penalty corners in the first eight minutes. From the fourth of these, Chris Massey cleverly touched in an angled Rob Sprawson drive to put the visitors in front but St Ives struck back quickly, first forcing Steve Parker into a point-blank save on the line and then equalising courtesy of a zig-zag move across the box following a failed defensive clearance.
Assured distribution and simple, direct moves from the midfield continued to put South under pressure and lack of marking at top D let St Ives in for a further big shot, again crucially blocked at close quarters by Parker. South weathered the storm though and, despite initial constipation on the right wing, gradually began to find more width. The final ten minutes of the half belonged to South, with several fine tackles and interceptions from Andy Rose and Chris Graveling, good combinations from Rick Erlebach and Jonny Tostevin in right midfield and some telling crosses from Rob Barton. A neat Sprawson-Massey short manoeuvre was deftly foiled, however, and the score remained 1-1 at the interval.
A sharp beginning to the second half soon brought dividends for South when Erlebach's free hit into the box was decisively rammed in by Barton in the 39th minute for a 2-1 lead. The same player shot just wide with a reverse-stick attempt two minutes later but was on hand to scramble home his second goal in the 43rd minute after strong pressure in the D.
South dominated the next phase of play, keeping the St Ives defence pinned in their own zone and moving the ball round smoothly and confidently. A near-goal from a Graveling flick was followed by a battery of shots from Rose, Barton and Sanjay Agarwala, all saved, and Rose was again unlucky to be denied with a reversed shot in the fiftieth minute. Despite intense vocal urgings from Peter Carey, however, South let St Ives back into the game when numerous failed tackles and a well-judged cross left a home attacker unmarked to reduce the deficit in the fifty-second minute.
Further breaks from St Ives were consummately halted by Graveling, marshalling the defence with calm authority from sweeper, and Carey, who then embarked on a trademark charge to the front, where Erlebach and Rose combined well on an overlap before Rose struck home for an aesthetically satisfying goal. By now, the tiring home defence had been ground down and the last ten minutes of the game belonged entirely to South. After the sixth short of the half, Matt Murray dribbled round the back to leave the now prolific Rob Hay with an easy conversion for 5-2. Further efforts from Erlebach, Murray, Hay and Agarwala  who seems to have developed a predilection for the side-netting  could have opened up the gap even further. An increasingly confident display was capped by the spectacle of a topless Rose apparently sunbathing on a post-match victory lap.

From the sidelines, captain Tim Waller wisely brought off Lewis, replacing him with the more defensively minded Jackson.
South contained and advanced play after this re-shuffle, creating half chances but no goals. Tim Poole, having his now trademark impressive and assertive game, repelled anything St Ives had to offer. As both teams became more frustrated and talkative, the umpires marshalled the game with intelligence and restraint, deciding on green cards rather than yellow.
An inspired and perceptive team talk from coach Mick Beasley encouraged South to play with more belief and purpose. The goals duly came. A promising move, in danger of breaking down outside the St Ives D, was revived by Waller, slipping the ball to Lewis, who forced a short corner. A crisp push-out from Lockhart and clean shot from Creed increased his tally to three league goals and galvanised South in the process. Passing became more defined and the versatile Devereux, now playing centre-mid, defended and distributed superbly. The in-form Nick Wong added to the score, finishing off a breakaway goal with some ease after some quick, simple passing. St Ives rallied resurgently, reducing the deficit to one.

The damage was inflicted in the first half as South scored three goals without reply.
South dominated straight from the starting pass although nearly came undone early on as the defence was caught forward and the St Neots centre forward broke through and, having rounded keeper Will Benedikz, shot wide.
It was Wilco Dijkstra who opened the scoring after just ten minutes with one of his trade mark back post finishes following good work down the right wing by Rory Johnson and James Bridge. The return of the latter strengthened the South midfield and it was he who scored the second goal from a penalty flick after a period where South continued to look a little vulnerable to counter attack.
A short corner was pushed out for James to shoot and his goal-bound shot was stopped by a foot on the St Neots line. Although the St Neots keeper did very well to reach the ball from the ensuing penalty flick he was unable to do more than push it into the side netting of the goal.
The forward line of Dijkstra, James Pope, Ali Blake and Rory Johnson, ably supported by the Bridge brothers, continued to harrass the St Neots backline. They forced a series of short corners at the end of the half and since the whistle went as the corner was taken South threw everyone forward. It was Wilco Dijkstra who scored from the second short corner, sneaking the ball home from close range.
St Neots reorganised in the second half and became more of a threat. The South defence of Andrew Leonard, John Benedikz and debutant Rod Richardson were put to the test on several occasions, only breaking once when a ball through the middle of them all was carefully placed past the out rushing keeper Will Benedikz. St Neots continued to break away and put pressure on South although none of their short corners proved to be threatening.

Chris Graveling gave South the lead after three minutes, catching the visiting keeper in no-man's land with a firm strike, and after two Horncastle breaks had been nullified by determined work from Peter Carey, John Taylor made it 2-0 in the tenth minute.
South exerted strong pressure for the next quarter of an hour, with Rob Sprawson, Andy Rose and Rob Barton all having shots saved and Graveling unlucky not to add to the score when a beautifully angled flick cannoned off a post, but then rather lost their shape in a disjointed passage of play up to half time. However, Jim Thorpe's no-nonsense tackling and a brief volley of saves from goalie Steve Parker, one from a clever deflection, kept the sheet clean.
Timely words from Mick Beasley at the interval helped South to re-organise and re-focus and, with incisive approach work based on good, simple triangles, the upper hand was swiftly regained. Sanjay Agarwala scored the third goal after thirty-nine minutes with a deceptively paced push, whilst Barton, Rose and Sprawson - the latter in a splendid imitation of Concorde without the sonic boom - were again to the fore. But it was Taylor who extended the lead in the fifty-seventh minute, drilling into the bottom corner after Rose gone in hard and had his shot only half-stopped.
Five minutes from the end, a snaking move involving Chris Massey, Rose and then Agarwala, who held the ball up teasingly to strand the keeper, left Sprawson unmarked in centre D to drive smartly in past a lone defender. Yet more chances followed, with Rob Hay and Rose combining neatly, but the last word was left to Taylor, who completed his hat-trick on the whistle by controlling well in the circle and shooting through the pads of the Horncastle keeper, who had nevertheless done much to avert an even bigger defeat for his side.
Whilst South showed their class in all areas of the field, rarely letting their opponents into the game, they should be under no illusions that stiffer challenges lie ahead. Skipper Steve Parker, who for once was rarely called into action, was delighted with the size of the victory but stressed that the side would need to learn how to keep its shape and composure in the face of tougher opposition.","Men's 1sts thrash Horncastle 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Otherwise the away defence stood firm with keeper Will Benedikz putting in some good saves and the back line playing with discipline.
In spite of good attacking moves, with skilful overlapping runners and some good crosses from returning skipper John Greaves on the right, South were unable to score before the interval.
All seemed lost when a penalty flick was conceded but Benedikz made amends by saving it brilliantly. This inspired the away team to attack with gusto and they were rewarded as Dan Adlington exchanged passes with Tom Bellis, ending in a terrific Adlington shot from a wide angle to pull a goal back. Thereafter South had most of the posession as they sought the equaliser. Stuart Creed was unlucky to shoot just wide from a short corner but soon after another well worked short corner routine gave Greaves the chance to slot the ball into the net behind the keeper at the near post from Creed's cross.
2-2 was a fair result, and encouraging for Cambridge South, who got back into the game after going two behind early on, through great commitment, with all the team playing their part well, and maintaining shape throughout. Men of the match were the centre midfield pairing of Creed and Korstanje, who are proving to be the hub of the team this season, controlling the game and launching many of our best moves.","Men's 2nds draw with Bourne 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

The first half was a tight affair in which South were probably the better team. The structure of the team did not suit the available players and, despite taking the lead through a James Pope goal, South never looked in control of the game after the first twenty minutes.
South started positively with good running and passing through the midfield of Ky Ho, Rod Richardson, David Bridge and Ian Perry. Up front, South looked strong but failed to turn possession into telling shots. Will Marston, at centre forward, was also dropping deep to help keep possession. However on two occasions strong attacks down the right wing through Will Marston, Ali Blake and the ever-present James Pope, resulted in crosses just missing the back post.
Ely were always strong on the counter attack and they had a number of opportunities, including four penalty corners, from which they could have scored. In the ensuing scramble following one of the their attacks David Bridge cleared the ball off the line, under considerable pressure from Ely, after keeper Will Benedikz was beaten.
Ironically it was another clearence by Will Benedikz that set up the attack from which South's goal was scored. His strong kick found Ali Blake with plenty of space at right midfield, his short run and sharp pass found James Pope who proceded to cut into the Ely circle. Having drawn then beaten the keeper James scored with a strong shot past the final defender.
The Ely side who came out after half-time were hungry for victory and forced South back on the defensive, using well supported attacks down both wings. Their first goal came almost directly from the restart. Breaking forward Ely won a short corner which was inventively switched across the circle for a relativlely easy shot home from the right wing. This spurred the visitors on whilst South became frustrated and disheartened, which led to a breakdown in the teams structure. Will Benedikz was forced to make a number of close range crosses in order to try and save a point from the game. Centre back John Benedikz also had another good performance and interchanged well with Ian Perry to vary the attacking options.
Chris Clegg continued his bright start for the club with a solid game at left back, whilst Andrew Leonard also played well on the opposite side of the defence. Andrew showed exceptional determination, which the team would do well to mimic in the future. When beaten by the Ely winger he sprinted back round and intercepted the ball at a second attempt.
James Pope, then Andrew Leonard, made goal saving clearences from high shots: Pope's being a shoulder height swing at the ball which a tougher umpire might well have punished more harshly than the long corner given.
The final goal came with just two minutes to play. Ely had an overlap of players on the right wing and drove to the back line before pulling a strong cross back to the the penalty spot from where it was swept home - a goal keeper's nightmare of a goal.
At the final whistle the more committed team had won although that was little consolation to a bitterly disappointed South side who should have taken something from the game.","Men's 3rds lose to Ely City 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Despite missing the considerable presences of Messrs Graveling, Sprawson and Readman, South were strong in all areas, with replacements John Benedikz and Keith Simpson giving a solid account of themselves and playing a full part in South's countless attacking moves. Benedikz was soon in the action as he, Jonny Tostevin and John Taylor interpassed neatly up the right flank, and the left side was no less productive as Chris Massey and Sanjay Agarwala repeatedly tantalised the overworked defence.
Although Alford had great difficulty breaking out of their own twenty-five, largely thanks to South's much-improved ringing of sixteens and free hits, it was not until the twenty minute mark that the visitors found the back of the net, when birthday boy John Taylor decisively put away a rebound from South's third short corner after Rick Erlebach had switched neatly to Rob Barton. Both Barton and Erlebach then had shots cleared off the line as the one-way traffic continued and the half closed with South's sixth short after an amusing melee in front of goal where at least five visiting attackers hacked unavailingly at the ball as the Alford keeper bravely tried to clear.
After the interval, South continued to press hard, with midfield dynamo Erlebach in superlative form, distributing the ball with vision and purpose and suffocating any attempt at an Alford breakout. South's constant possession finally told in the thirty-seventh minute when Erlebach again switched to Barton at a short for the latter to rip one through the goalie's pads. Driven on by a watchful Jim Thorpe, whose magisterial pronouncement that ""the level of hockey has dropped considerably"" obviously had some effect, South won their eleventh penalty corner five minutes later and Erlebach gained his just reward by firing home off a defender's stick.
The home side then went four down when Peter Carey, manfully holding off a defender to the right of the D, slipped a pass back into the centre for a tenacious Benedikz to surprise everyone but himself with a sweetly-timed shot through his own, and the goalie's, legs. After a rare Alford attack had been calmly hoovered up by Thorpe and Simpson, Barton converted from Erlebach to make it 5-0 and the game was closed out with a further burst of shorts to bring South's tally for the match to fifteen.
A deflating afternoon for the home side was rescued only by a gutsy performance from their keeper, who had earlier vied with Agarwala, Barton & co. to see who could arrive at the ground latest. South skipper Steve Parker, whose most significant intervention of the day was to win the toss, said the team could have done with a tougher work-out in the lead-up to the crucial Spalding match but was nonetheless delighted with the way his revamped team had dismissed the opposition.","Men's 1sts thrash Alford 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Consistently purposeful play using the width of the pitch well gained reward from early on, with Jackson scoring the first with a rasping shot following a well practiced Greaves/Korstanje short corner routine.
The second came from open play with the quietly dominant Vincent Korstanje finding Nick Wong, whose blistering pace was a constant threat, on the right. Wong crossed precisely to Andy Lewis who turned and shot neatly past the keeper.
At 2-0 the game was still fairly even, but South upped the pressure with three more goals in quick succession from Jackson (close range after Korstanje found Wong on the right to cross to Jackson waiting close in), Lewis (long range shot following move down the centre), and Greaves (trademark near post routine from a short corner). By this stage the game had opened up, to allow all the CSHC players to contribute to attacks, although Poole was required on three occasions to make sharp saves to retain our status as the league's meanest defence.

Cambridge South launched a number of determined attacks from the start of the first half, many of which led to short corners but unfortunately no goals. The Long Sutton goalie had the approach of smothering the ball, lying flat, at short corners - a tactic that may have been heavily penalised by some umpires and which led to some messy goal mouth scrambles. An experimental high flick at one of Cambridge South's short corners unfortunately was premature - the goalie had not yet dived to the floor!
Long Sutton always looked dangerous on the break - they had strong players along a central axis of centre back, centre midfield and centre forward - but the Cambridge South defence didn't panic and held firm. Andrew Leonard and Rod Richardson surpassed themselves and kept position well, slowing attacks and allowing the midfield to return to support. Finn Johnson at right back also had a very strong game and supported the midfield admirably.
Cambridge South had the majority of possession and attacks and this eventually paid off when a long corner from James Bridge found James Pope at the edge of the circle. His strike at goal was slowed by the Long Sutton defence but then driven home by David Bridge to put Cambridge 1-0 ahead. South continued to look dangerous with Jack Chalk leading the attacks from centre forward. Support came from wingers Rory Johnson and Wilco Dijkstra who were a continuous danger to the home side's defence.
Just before half-time one of Long Sutton attacks led to a short corner and the resultant strike, rising slightly towards the goal was deflected below the backboard to level the score at 1-1.
A rousing half-time talk inspired South to keep playing hard in the second half despite the psychological disadvantage of entering the half having just conceded a goal. Cambridge launched attack after attack but also had to face a series of short corners from Long Sutton arising from counter attacks. Goalkeeper Will Benedikz did very well to keep a clean sheet, making two key saves from Long Sutton strikes. Rod Richardson and James Pope also made goal line clearances to keep the game alive.
Throughout the second half it was Cambridge that looked the more dangerous and it was they who eventually scored again. A build up by the famous Johnson brothers (Finn and Rory), who played intelligent passing hockey all game and never stopped running, found Wilco Dijkstra who slotted home yet another goal at the far post.
Cambridge also had a number of near misses - Rory Johnson was taken out by the Long Sutton goal-keeper inside the D, a spectacular run by James Pope from the sixteen yard line all the way to the opposing D unfortunately ended in a miss-hit, a desperate lunge by James Bridge beat the Long Sutton goal-keeper and full back but unfortunately passed just the wrong side of the goal post.
Towards the end tempers were close to fraying on both sides but the game was a good lesson in that Cambridge South won by playing to the very end despite exhaustion and frustration at launching many attacks which came to nothing. The midfield of David Bridge, James Bridge and James Pope achieved an incredible work-rate throughout the whole game and never failed to support either the defence or attack.","Men's 3rds draw against Long Sutton 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Both teams struggled to create any clear advantages in the opening exchanges, though Steve Parker was quickly into the action with a left-footed clearance from a dangerous Spalding though ball. At the other end, John Taylor forced his way into the D after a telling thrust up the right from Jonny Tostevin and Chris Graveling fed Rob Barton for a trademark reverse shot, which was well blocked.
By the fifteen minute mark, South had gradually begun to create more room for themselves with some incisive passing hockey and, after a fine clearance from the immaculate Jim Thorpe at sweeper, concerted pressure in the Spalding D resulted in Barton pouncing on a rebound to make it 1-0 after twenty-two minutes.
South's first short minutes later nearly doubled the lead as Graveling tipped the ball just past the post from a thunderous Rob Sprawson strike. Sanjay Agarwala, who tormented the Spalding defence throughout, then blasted spectacularly over the bar on the right and Barton, with (almost) balletic grace, sent an equally powerful backhander wide on the left. Surviving a short that was drilled past the post, South ended the half clearly on top thanks to their increasing domination of the midfield.
The pattern continued after the interval and it was no surprise when Barton, well positioned as ever, was on the spot to snap in the second after forty-two minutes following Sprawson's determined surge into the Spalding circle. The visitors came back strongly at this point, however, winning a penalty corner which was struck wide and then forcing Parker to save well and tidy up after a burst down the right which saw them clear in the D. After a home short from Sprawson was kicked out, South endured a hectic five minutes following a defensive rearrangement and Parker made a crucial stick save diving to his right when Spalding appeared to be through.
Chris Graveling's reappearance at sweeper steadied the ship and play immediately switched to the other end, where a speculative long hit seemed to strike the post, leading to a short but fruitless bout of hacking and chopping round the besieged Spalding goalie. A flowing move stemming from Rick Erlebach and Matt Readman, who repeatedly impressed with his sang-froid when finessing the ball out of defence, exerted further pressure up front, subsequently augmented by a good diagonal run from Rob Hay and another sparkling surge from the tireless Readman.
A third short for Spalding on sixty-two minutes was confidently blocked and cleared by Parker and, moments later, Spalding's hopes of a comeback were finally extinguished when Barton was brought down in the D and Graveling expertly converted the flick as the goalie went the wrong way.
The final five minutes belonged almost exclusively to South as Barton forced the goalie into a double pad save and Taylor wrong-footed everyone by preceding a booming drive with a graceful, though possibly unintentional, air shot.
The most impressive feature of the game, which saw South playing their best hockey for some considerable time, was the collective vision and distributing ability of the midfield, spearheaded by Graveling, Tostevin, Readman, the unshowily reliable Keith Simpson and an increasingly authoritative Chris Massey, who put in a near-faultless performance; special mention should be made, too, of Jim Thorpe's laser-like pass upfield to Erlebach, which, by his own account, was a thing of beauty. South's flowing, often one-time moves denied their opponents any worthwhile possession for long periods, engendering confidence within the side and creating a momentum which everyone hopes can be sustained over the coming weeks.
Skipper Steve Parker, reflecting on an excellent team performance to which everyone contributed, stressed that the side had set high standards which would need to be maintained, not least in the upcoming fixture against a parsimonious Long Sutton.","Men's 1sts beat Spalding 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

First - CSHC playing well, with promising attacks, and a number of chances made particularly from Matt Murray, and from a sound short corner routine, but sadly not converted.
Second - CSHC getting sloppy, and letting in two soft goals through failing to mark all attackers and then not stopping a cross before it was deflected over the line. At this stage the away team almost came back into the game as an Andy Lewis shot was blocked by a defensive foot, only for the well taken Korstanje penalty flick to be saved.
Third - CSHC failing to string moves together through poor passing and not moving well off the ball. Ely attacks were snuffed out by the solid defensive combination of McIlwaine/Sutcliffe/Clark/Brynjolffssen.
Fourth - CSHC throwing caution to the wind, particularly after Ely scored a breakaway third goal in spite of Mark Jackson's heroic attempt to run back to thwart the attacker. There followed CSHC's best period, rewarded by numerous short corners and a first goal for the club for Jan Brynjolffssen, pouncing on a loose ball at close range after one such corner. Dan Adlington, menacing throughout, got a second as the ball came to him during yet another post-short corner scramble near the top of the D. Unfortunately time ran out before CSHC were able to get the equaliser, although it looked more than likely in the closing stages.

The game started badly for South with a goal being conceded in the first five minutes. An uncoordinated starting pass was seized on by March who eventually forced South into conceding a penalty corner. The well-rehearsed manoeuvre resulted in a shot being slotted under on-rushing keeper Will Benedikz into the centre of the goal for the worst possible start.
After this initial set back South became much more solid at the back as people adjusted to their positions. The backline of Chris Clegg, Ky Ho and Andrew Pounce, covered by John Benedikz at sweeper, stood firm for the rest of the half and also had Will Benedikz to thank for several important saves.
Whilst the team was under siege for most of the half, the few counterattacks made by the South midfield were always dangerous. They swept forward strongly and forced several short corners. Finally Cambridge's opening goal came with about five minutes of the half left. A Nick Wong led counterattack moved swiftly down the right wing before cutting in and taking a shot on goal. The original shot was saved but the keeper was last to react and Rory Johnson poked the ball over the goal line.
The half finished with a little additional drama; having received a green card from the semi-over-zealous March umpire Nick Wong was extremely unfortunate to be yellow carded for over appealling, the decision coming as something of a shock to the South team.
South started the second half in the same way as they had begun the first. They suffered a lack of direction and ingenuity, which allowed March to establish constant pressure and ultimately led to their second goal from a short corner part way through the half. The visitors scored a third later courtesy of a poor goalkeeping judgement that prevented the sweeper clearing and allowed a simple tap in for March.
After the hour mark it was all change for South. March Town showed why they were so low in the league as South woke up and played some very positive attacking hockey. Flowing moves down the right involving James Bridge, Will Marston and the returning Nick Wong, created several openings. Not to be outshone on the left flank David Bridge and Finn Johnson combined effectively to further the pressure on the March defence. The pressure began to tell as the visitors defended desperately and gave away a string of free hits on the edge of their circle. The first of these went narrowly wide of a post as the ever-present Wilco Dijkstra could not quite reach to tip it in. The second caught March napping as they backed off leaving James Bridge, unmarked on top of their D, to receive a simple pass and strike it into the bottom corner.
The second goal really lifted South and they threatened to force an equaliser as March wilted. Unfortunately time was against them and the final whistle went. Although South could justifiably feel harshly dealt with over a number of incidents the next step in building the team is to rally round each other in such circumstances, rise above the frustrations and run the game with a demonstration of the kind of quality hockey we are more than capable of playing.
South have four more games until Christmas against teams that they can, should and must beat, if attaining a top top finish is to remain a believable goal. Both St Neots 5ths and St Ives 5ths looked vulnerable as South beat them in the first round of games. Peterborough Town 5ths are unpredictable but generally weak and must be beaten. The most important game is the visit of Spalding 3rds who should not be fooled into relishing the trip south.

Missing the influential Matt Readman, Chris Massey and Peter Carey as well as Andy Rose and John Taylor (the latter banished to Siberia after failing to score last week), South conceded an early lead when the defence was wrong-footed by a deflection from a home long corner.
Despite two short corner opportunities and creative runs from Jonny Tostevin and Sanjay Agarwala on the wings, South failed to tax the Long Sutton defence sufficiently over the first quarter, and both Chris Graveling and Jim Thorpe had to bring off inch-perfect tackles to prevent the home team making further inroads. Long Sutton's slick short routine was twice bravely thwarted by Keith Simpson and South escaped further punishment when Rick Erlebach's last-gasp intervention forced a home attacker to slice just wide after running unchallenged from halfway.
The pendulum swung slightly in the final ten minutes of the half as Tostevin drew two good saves from the keeper and Erlebach and Rob Barton at last found some room for manoeuvre. Hopes of a second-period comeback were quickly dashed, however, when, from a thirty-eighth minute short corner, Long Sutton went two ahead with a well-placed drag flick of a pace and weight rarely seen at this level.
South swiftly countered with three shorts of their own but, despite gaining a rebound and laying on a deft switch, stopper Graveling saw his efforts go unrewarded. Long Sutton then gradually forced the South defence deeper by playing a man high and the action soon reverted to the visitors' D, with Steve Parker first blocking a player coming in from wide and then making a sliding tackle at the edge of the circle to break up another threatening move.
Frustration began to set in at this point and South's hitting from defence became less assured as they struggled to find consistency. There was little of the midfield cohesion that was so much of a hallmark of the Spalding game and South largely had to rely for their chances on the strong and inventive running of Agarwala, who evaded a tenacious marker to sprint round the back of the defence and go clear in the D, only to be foiled by a good save.
South pressed forward with increasing urgency, Barton giving his all in a clash of titans with the keeper, but Long Sutton, who were unafraid to bang the ball down the wings, repelled further danger despite Agarwala again going close on the far post in the final minutes. The key strengths of South's game in previous weeks - decisive clearances, coherent support play through the middle and control in the opposition 25 - were not so evident against the determined and well-disciplined Lincolnshire side and, though luck in the D notably deserted them, South could have no complaints about the final result.","Men's 1sts lose to Long Sutton 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Jim Lockhart ignited South's play with a coolly taken goal; netting after his first shot was parried back to him.
South soon gained control over the game with Dan Adlington's mopped up effort after twenty minutes. With no sign of our two errant subs, the home team started to gel as an eleven after the early disarray.
March always threatened but were consistently disheartened by some fabulous goalkeeping by the Welsh wizard, Tim Poole. Making some outrageously fine saves, Tim's brilliance provided a source of frustration with pivotal interceptions throughout the game.
The other inspirational figure was Matt Readman spoiling attacks and instigating South's best play.
After a Beasley team talk at the break, alerting various possible dangers, South instantly added to their score, forcing a short corner and converting a neat Korstanje lay off to skipper Creed who gathered and shot deftly.
March were now being played out of the game. ""Sleepy-head"" Adlington dispatched his second deliciously, after excellent supporting work from Readman and Wong. The latter chased a lost ball for a cut back past a dejected left back.
The final strike on sixty-nine minutes was pure class: Lewis slipped the ball to Adlington on the edge of the D who then blasted a cracking right wing cross for Wong to finish confidently as he ghosted in to the centre of the D.
Matt Murray had an excellent game as emergency sweeper in light of our limited options brought about by being two subs light. In the end it mattered not.

To be fair, Peterborough, the division's bottom side, played to a level that belied their league position.
The tone for the match was set early on when a normally harmless through ball was ignored completely by South and nearly resulted in a Peterborough forward being clean through on goal. Only a timely intervention by the keeper prevented the worst possible start to the game.
After this initial distraction however South dominated possession for the remainder of the half, without really taking controlling the game as expected. Even without dominating the game the defence of Daniel Raffle, John Benedikz and Andrew Pounce, supported by defensive links Ali Blake and David Bridge, never really looked troubled and certainly didn't look as if they would concede a goal. At the other end of the pitch the forward line of Finn Johnson, new recruit Andy Kennedy and Wilco Dijkstra, with midfield attacks from James Bridge and Rory Johnson won a series of short corners, which though well struck by Messrs Bridge and Dijkstra failed to find the final touch into the net.
During one of South's sustained periods of attack Rory Johnson was caught across the knee which gave rise to injury worries and held up the game. Despite having to leave the field for a short while Rory made a good return to play.
South's frustrations were summed up when an attack down the right was squared perfectly across the front of the goal past Peterborough's keeper, only for South's frontline to slice the ball wide of an open goal. The half-time whistle provided a perfect opportunity for South to re-group and revise their strategy.
The second half opened with Peterborough playing more aggressively. They pushed forward much more and made use of substitutes by replaced their young forward line with a pair of very competent adults. Ironically this aggressive stance gave South the advantage as it was from the breakdown of one of the Peterborough attacks that South finally managed to score from one of the best counterattacks of the season. Making use of the pace down the right side of the pitch South entered the circle and Rory Johnson was able to smash home a powerful shot.
With their noses in front South looked a more settled but Peterborough were far from beaten. South attacked well down both wings but Peterborough were using experienced players across the defence and forward line whilst making little use of their midfield. Each time a South movement broke down Peterborough took a quick ball and were on the offensive immediately. The South defence stood firm and were well supported from midfield although it was obvious that the lack of substitutes meant fatigue had set in early.
With under ten minutes to play, South finally broke. Peterborough, sensing they were far from being pushed over, increased the intensity of their attacks and scrambled an equaliser. Their centre forward shook off several tackles and shot, however a poor clearance by keeper Will Benedikz went out to another attacker. The second shot was also saved. However the Peterborough forward collected the ball and forced the ball over the line. This was achieved despite the best efforts of Daniel Raffle on the goal line who stopped the ball crossing the line twice before being beaten.

Had the match started at the appointed time, the lone March representative might have had a difficult time keeping a punctual South at bay but clemency on the part of the officials allowed for a fifteen minute delay while the visitors managed to gather an impressive starting eight. The slick attacking moves that South had been assiduously practising for half an hour beforehand were based on facing a full complement, so it was no surprise that, despite Keith Simpson's rapid distribution and Andy Rose's exploitation of an agoraphobia-inducing space on the left, the home side were unable to unleash a meaningful attack until the remaining three March miscreants had sheepishly slunk on. By this point, though, Sanjay Agarwala had already engaged top gear and was unlucky not to score after taking an incisive through pass from a keen-jawed Matt Readman. Readman and Rose then combined prettily up the left before Chris Massey's visionary pass just outpaced the onrushing Agarwala.
There was a short period where March started to marshal their defence effectively and put South under some pressure but Jim Thorpe, tackling and reverse-stopping with his customary nonchalance, and the rest of the defence held firm even when March finally penetrated the home D. South then took charge and, ignoring an unpenalised blatant foot offence by a March defender, drove forward with a classy interchange between Rick Erlebach and Peter Carey which resulted in a clear chance for Massey. Massey's shot was well saved by the keeper but Steve Fleck, a welcome returnee after flirting with the Seniors' Tour, was on hand to apply a clinical finish. Carey then nearly added a second with a touch of Irish by racing in behind the keeper, who seemed to misread Massey's well-disguised cross from the right, and Massey himself  deputising up front for the injured Rob Barton  was also close to scoring when he drilled the ball low to the goalie's left but saw it just skim past the post.
Fleck again pleased the eye with a mazy crossfield run towards the end of the half and, although March briefly looked dangerous, hitting a tricky through ball which Steve Parker confidently despatched to the wing (along with Erlebach and a March attacker), South reached the thirty-five minute mark well in the ascendancy.
The second stanza began with some excellent three-man passing moves, with Fleck hitting through Chris Graveling to Erlebach, who had his shot blocked, and also feeding Jonny Tostevin and Carey for another diagonal burst. Then Readman added a piledriver of his own and the momentum was now all with South, especially when Simpson crashed upfield like a one-man rolling maul. After forty-seven minutes, Fleck, on an assist from Massey, found Agarwala unmarked on the edge of the D and the latter fired home jubilantly to make it 2-0.
Responding with more than a hint of the agricultural, March then gave away a string of short corners, first tripping Simpson up on a surge and then halting a belligerent Carey drive with a very guilty foot. Stopper Chris Graveling shot well and switched neatly, both to no avail, but after fifty-one minutes, Rob Sprawson  who had earlier replaced ankle injury victim Rose (thereafter a wet but philosophical spectator)  chose his spot and put the ball out of the goalie's reach into the bottom corner. A further effort when Carey netted a rebound after Erlebach's shot had hit a post was ruled out but South kept their foot on the gas as Readman bossed the midfield, neatly sidestepping a variety of interesting tackles.
March finally incurred the umpires' wrath when one of their number was yellowed after crudely horizontalising the nippy Erlebach and South made them pay with two further strikes, one from Graveling  unmarked near the top of the circle  and the other from a determined Agarwala, fed by Sprawson. After sixty-five minutes, March won their first short corner, shooting wide, but then scored despite Steve Parker's excellent first save.
The remaining minutes of the game disappeared in a rain-soaked blur as your correspondent's notebook finally dissolved into a handful of papier mch, but of a convincing home win there could be no doubt. Skipper Steve Parker praised the team for an intense and committed performance that ground the opposition down as surely as the England pack did their Australian counterparts.","Men's 1sts beat March Town 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Sadly that was only the second half.
In the first half Boston scored three without reply, all from their star centre forward, who managed to get away from the markers and get to the ball more quickly than those around him on all three occasions. CSHC were under pressure throughout the half, and it was only the masterful Poole diving repeatedly to thwart shots, who kept the score down. The defence stuck to the task resolutely, and there were a few breakaway attacks, but the final ball eluded the away side.
After half time, CSHC got into the game and had several good attacks with numerous crosses from the lively Lewis and Greaves sadly not converted. Boston got their fourth against the run of play, and the consolation goal came from a move through the centre by Jackson and Waller, who grew in confidence during the game to make an effective midfield combination. The ball came to the lurking Greaves close to the penalty spot, who pounced on it and pushed it past the diving keeper.

South who have performed below standard in recent weeks raised their game several notches and, aided by the return of several key players, proceeded to put up a good display.
South started the match with several attacks pushing Spalding onto the back foot. One attack down the right flank was finished off by a magnificent James Pope strike, which took a small deflection off the on-rushing keeper to land millimetres over the bar.
After five minutes Spalding arranged themselves and looked much more solid at the back, allowing them to push up the field. Spalding pushed South onto the defensive and the back line of Ky Ho, John Benedikz and Rod Richardson, ably supported by Tom Harrison and Andy Kennedy in the defensive link roles, were all required to stay alert to keep the visitors at bay. From one attack Spalding won a short corner. However, their eventual shot was stopped on the line. Unfortunately for South it was a foot and not stick which stopped the ball and a penalty flick was awarded. The resulting flick was crucially saved by keeper Will Benedikz keeper; his third save in four flicks this season.
Spalding finally made the break through after fifteen minutes when a ball went loose along the back line and was lifted over the keeper from a very acute angle into the net. With the score at one-nil a pattern of attack and counter attack developed from which a number of short corners were awarded for both teams. Whilst South failed to make the most of theirs Spalding used theirs to good effect. Their third short corner being cleanly struck into the bottom right of the goal.
The second half was a real credit to the third team's ability to play for one another as a team. They defended from the front with the Bridge brothers, James and David, shadowing players back whilst the defensive links and back line closely marked players running through. On South's sixteen yard hits the Spalding ring was broken up allowing the ball to get to the wingers Ali Blake and Wilco Dijkstra. These two, plus James Pope and Finn Johnson, were then able to launch some effective counter attacks at the opposition defence. Conversely when Spalding were trying to clear their lines South players were always making life difficult by tackling and blocking passes.
In the end the second half reached a stalemate with neither side having many chances on goal.
Cambridge South put up a spirited performance against a team that, last season, were two divisions above them and ultimately were unlucky not to take a point from the game. Spalding failed to live up to this season's fearsome reputation and South made them look fallible. Certainly had South played against any lesser team goals and points would have been forthcoming. The side should take heart from this performance. They can really believe that by playing with this degree of level-headedness, commitment and determination there will be many more wins than losses this season.

South made the running right from the start, with livewire Sanjay Agarwala seeing plenty of action on the left wing and Peter Carey in a roving defensive-cum-attacking vein prominent just about everywhere. Agarwala and the equally ubiquitous Chris Massey both had shots well saved and short corner attempts from Rob Sprawson and switch-man Steve Fleck were also on target. The occasional Nomadic foray was firmly repelled by an uncompromising Jim Thorpe as South patiently built up their game, exploring both wings and playing the triangles nicely.
Matt Readman, calmness personified as ever, spread the ball round well and, on twenty-five minutes, took the opportunity to move upfield and slot home crisply through traffic from the top of the D to make it 1-0. Further good work from Massey, ball apparently welded to his stick, and the persevering Jonny Tostevin on the right increased the pressure and, after Readman and Matt Murray had engaged in a neat one-two, a fractal run by Fleck put Murray clear on the spot and the good doctor finished the move with clinical precision to double the lead after thirty-one minutes. Nomads threatened briefly when a skimmer was deflected just wide but a half-time advantage of 2-0 was no more than South deserved.
Rob Barton, returning from injury and with a goal already under his belt from earlier in the day, quickly made his presence felt with a cunning reverse pass after a South short and master and commander Chris Graveling was on hand to unleash a cannon into the bottom left-hand corner and put clear water between the sides. A superb multi-directional move stemming from a big Thorpe clearance and involving Barton, Agarwala and Sprawson deserved better than a turnover and a Nomads break but Thorpe was reassuringly in position to defuse the threat.
Despite a good debut from Mark Jackson on the left and persistent attacking intent, South hit a slightly rocky patch hereabouts and, after fifty-one minutes, a nasty hole opened up in the D, leaving a Nomads forward to roof a first-timer home from five yards. A further home goal at this point might have jangled the nerves but keeper Steve Parker first blocked a sharp hit from an unmarked Nomads attacker and then clawed down a flick from the same player to spare South's blushes.
With moral fibre stiffened by Thorpe's schoolmasterly promptings - a pained ""This is shocking!"" perhaps the most effective - South swiftly regained control and Murray nearly got through on a sliderule feed from Carey, while Graveling and Sprawson played havoc with the Nomads defence, the former bouncing a flick off the goalie's chest and the latter reversing a subtle pass to Murray. The pressure finally told and, from a sixty-sixth minute short, Fleck found space to make it 4-1 with a wily raised deflection from Sprawson's well-angled drive - a textbook goal which left both defenders and keeper powerless.
Skipper Steve Parker, after delivering an impassioned pre-match speech, was satisfied with the victory whilst expressing some concern with the team's occasionally shaky second half showing. He added that he was looking for a commanding performance in the final league game before the Christmas break.

They were up to the task, especially the disciplined and effective Andy Bleach and the assertive Matt Bailey. Unfortunately on the occasion that an attacker was left unmarked, he snuck in to grab the opening Wisbech goal.
CSHC were then able to get more into the game and force some short corners which were sadly not converted. Most of the home attacks came from opportunist moves by the lively Lewis, who was a constant threat. The ball arrived in the Wisbech D enough times, but the final strike eluded the CSHC forwards.
The second and third Wisbech goals came shortly after half time, one from a speculative cross which found its way into the goal without anyone touching it, the other from that unmarked forward once again. As often happens, South then became more purposeful and the final quarter was their best period, including a deserved goal for Adlington after a quickly taken Creed free hit.
Umpire Pride got himself more involved in the game than expected by a deft header, which unfortunately failed to find a CSHC stick, but made a nice noise.

Notable absentees included Messrs. Carey (fatherhood), Massey, Tostevin, Rose and Thorpe - the latter apparently away on a business trip rather than curry-tasting in preparation for the forthcoming social - and this forced a major defensive rejig with a back line of Keith Simpson, Rob Hay and John Benedikz partnering Matt Readman at sweeper.
Simpson and Readman were quickly instrumental in dispossessing Wisbech down the right and, thanks to Readman's intricate manoeuvring and drive upfield, South were immediately able to set up camp in the visitors' twenty-five. Excellent ringing of hits out kept the Wisbech defence under constant pressure, allowing Chris Graveling, Steve Fleck and the electric Sanjay Agarwala to give full rein to their skills and it was no surprise when the first goal arrived after eight minutes. Rick Erlebach, returning to the heart of midfield, flat-footed two defenders with a superbly-weighted through ball which Agarwala sprinted on to, forcing the keeper into a rash clearance attempt with his stick. Agarwala then whipped the ball away from him, raced along the goal-line and delivered an inch-perfect feed to the onrushing John Taylor, who used his exceptional reach to beat off the competition and slot home on the reverse side.
A series of South shorts followed, with Rob Sprawson and Graveling drawing saves from the keeper, who made up in bulk for what he lacked in balance. A rare foray by the Wisbech forwards was neatly thwarted by an interception and save from Steve Parker in the home goal before the one-way traffic resumed as Fleck just failed to round the keeper on a three-on-one break which left the defence for dead.
Two further shorts met with an equal lack of success and it looked as though South might only have a single goal to show for their first half efforts when Erlebach, who had just stemmed the tide as Wisbech flooded down the right wing, hokey-cokeyed into the visitors' D and beat three men before teeing it up for Steve Fleck to bulge the net with a clean first-time strike, a move described by unofficial team guru Mick Beasley as ""liquid hockey"".
The second half started in similar vein, with Erlebach ""scoring"" from just outside the D after Agarwala had conjured a centring pass out of nothing, and both Fleck and Graveling having good attempts well blocked. A momentary wobble on the left was rescued by the strong-running Simpson and, when Wisbech finally created enough room to string one or two passes together, Readman and Benedikz cleared their lines in unflustered fashion.
Respite for the visitors was only temporary, though, as Agarwala - who earlier in the game had given a great display of two-way hockey by racing back fifty yards to win the ball in left defence - started a three man move which saw Fleck net his second from a wrong-footing reverse-stick pass by Rob Barton. Wisbech countered with a penalty corner but the D remained inviolate thanks to solid team defence and the Wisbech midfield were gradually strangled again.
Agarwala, Fleck and Barton contrived to win more short corners for South and Sprawson and Taylor completely dominated the right hand side, with the latter's shoot-on-sight policy posing a particular threat to the visitors' goal. But despite two further shorts in the last five minutes, the home side could not add to their tally and, though the Wisbech goalie recovered well from an awkward start to keep the score within respectable bounds, it was slightly disappointing that none of the nine penalty corners South won was converted.
Nevertheless, the overall team performance was confident and committed and 100% effort and discipline was maintained for at least 65 minutes. The ""new-look"" defence gave nothing away - with Hay in particular playing a superb positional game - and everyone contributed to creating a steady supply of chances, thus showing the side can play both solid and liquid hockey!
South have reached the halfway point in the season in positive form, with a wide range of scorers, a solid defensive core, good reserve strength and, importantly, momentum and self-belief. Skipper Steve Parker, taking time out from intense negotiations for a six-figure nude calendar deal for the team, stressed that, in the words of a slightly more famous leader, ""This was not the beginning of the end, but more probably the end of the beginning"". On a more serious note, he praised the 1st team squad for the considerable strides made in the first half of the season while emphasising the need to maintain the impetus built up so far. He also pointed out that, with key members of the squad unavailable for much of the second half, there was absolutely no room for complacency.","Men's 1sts beat Wisbech Town 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Then St Neots scored after a goalmouth scramble following one of their rare short corners and it was all downhill from then on.
Although Cambridge South continued to have enough of the ball and were able to get into dangerous areas, they gave the ball away far too often to an increasingly confident home side who played well as a team. St Neots managed to control the game through the simple expedient of retaining the ball, and passing it to their own teammates, particularly getting the ball to their best player on a regular basis.
Man of the match Matt Bailey was the pick of a solid South defence, aided by the versatile Stuart Creed playing out of his normal position at right back. Jim Sutcliffe managed one calm goal line clearance as if he practiced them daily.

All South's problems came in the first five minutes when they let in two sloppy goals which allowed the visitors to relax into their game whilst South were left chasing for goals. Both goals were scored by the same forward; firstly shooting under the keeper following a swift break, the second touching home a close range cross at the back post having gain a pace on his marker. After their initial jitters South settled down and, despite continuing to look vulnerable to swift counterattacks, began to control the game.
South pulled a goal back within another five minutes through an extremely efficient counterattack down the right wing. The build up play involved Ali Blake and James Bridge before centre forward Shantanu Golar selflessly ignored his own scoring opportunity and passed the ball across the front of goal for Wilco Dilkstra to calmly score. Having scored, South pushed on to look for the equaliser led from the front by Dijkstra, Golar and Blake and reinforced by the powerful runs of James Bridge.
At the back the defence of Andrew Pounce and Rod Richardson ably led by Ky Ho resisted all further attacks thrown at them for the rest of the half. Daniel Raffle replaced Pounce for the second quarter of the game and look comfortable covering his marker.
Following minor changes to the team by master tactician Mick Beasley, Cambridge South came out fighting after the break and dominated the second half. The team were extremely unlucky to not secure an equaliser and made a number of good shooting chances.
Regular attacks were launched down both wings through David Bridge and Finn Johnson, who played with much more control having rested to allow Andrew Pounce back onto the pitch. John Benedikz who started in midfield dropped back to aid the defence and South adopted a 4-4-2 formation.
Ali Blake and Shantanu Golar, assisted by Andrew Pounce, proved to be constant problem to the St Neots defence. Both forward players were moving the ball round well and creating opportunities through thoughtful play.
Throughout the half South forced a number of short corners. These were taken well, using South's well practised routine, and St Neots keeper was forced to make several saves. It was from a penalty corner that South came closest to an equaliser. A good strike from James Bridge towards the back post was instinctively forced towards goal by Dijkstra, but unluckily it went just no more than two inches wide.
Towards the final five minutes of the game legs on both sides were tired. St Neots took to keeping players forward and launching the ball forward in hope every time a South attack was broken down. As South searched desperately for the deserved equaliser an intercepted ball, followed by cramp to his marker, allowed one final St Neots attack. Although the unchecked run was finally met by Will Benedikz at the top of the D, the ball squirmed underneath the keeper and the same striker bundled the ball home to complete his hat-trick. Credit goes to Andrew Pounce and Daniel Raffle for their valiant attempt to keep the ball out.
Following last weeks heavy defeat South did extremely well to turn themselves round and, with the exception of the first five minutes, showed they were by far the better team. Passing, running in support, tackling and commitment were all improved beyond recognition.
At the start of the season we showed that we are more than capable of matching our opponents in this league. The team has suffered through some inconsistency of availability but we have improved, both individually and as a team, since the start of the season. By continuing to play as we can we will rise back up through the league to a more fitting position.","Men's 3rds lose to St Neots 5","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Matt Bailey lent the defence a festive note with some seasonal red tones in a kaleidoscopic plumage, whilst Santa-half was also rather ""Chris-Massey"" (end of Xmas jokes, Yule be pleased to hear).
Massey it was who dominated in the first ten minutes, with several brick-wall tackles and a nice line in twists, turns and bluffs that created plenty of space for midfield and forwards alike. He was aided by Rob Hay, also in stolid form at the rear, and South worked some good fast moves through Jonny Tostevin and John Taylor before winning their first short after fifteen minutes. After superb work by Fleck, a well-placed Andy Lewis creamed the ball elegantly over the bar just like Jonny Wilkinson but was crestfallen to be told his effort wasn't going to be credited with three points. Taylor then made an incisive goal-line dart to leave Hay and Lewis, again in the danger area, fighting out a gentlemen's excuse-me which allowed a grateful Nomads defender to clear.
A second South short was nearly put away by Massey on the post from a Fleck strike before Nomads started to turn the tables. Despite a determined run from defence by Matt Readman, sure-footed as a mountain goat, the visitors soon broke through into the D, where Steve Parker spreadeagled himself to make an excellent save with an attacker clear away. Massey, Rob Barton and Fleck then engineered a worthy shooting chance at the other end which somehow got lost when they all apparently tried to tackle each other.
But Nomads surged back and, though Bailey heroically closed down a dangerous attack on the right and then - inside knowledge to the fore - blindsided the umpire with a nifty block from the right instep, Parker had to be at his best to keep the visitors at bay. After several fine tackles, however, his defences were finally breached on twenty-six minutes when there was no-one on hand to clear a good stick save and the ball was bundled into the goal to give Nomads the lead.
South recovered swiftly from this setback, with Massey again making the pace and, after Parker had cleared smoothly to the wings, Matt Murray's laser-guided aerial ball set Barton free to cross to the centre, where Lewis pounced on a rebound from the goalie and rammed the ball unhesitatingly home for the equaliser just before half-time.
The second stanza saw Agarwala re-inventing himself as a left-back - with no little success - and Readman and Tostevin joining the attack on a more frequent basis. Massey outfoxed several midfielders with a devastating pirouette and dash before taking a painful blow on the hand which elicited a manly epithet, whilst Readman displayed a neat body jink that sent three opponents the wrong way all at once. Nomads managed a couple of penalty corners in the first fifteen minutes of the half but scoring chances were scarce on both sides despite the open nature of the game.
The visitors' younger contingent, who were impressively talented, played their full part in some flowing hockey but the next clear-cut opportunity fell to Barton, whose reverse-stick shot after fifty-five minutes was firmly struck but well saved. Fleck nearly broke the deadlock with a great effort on South's sixth short corner, Tostevin and Taylor put together a neat move which narrowly evaded conversion and Murray barged through four tackles before being stopped on the gain line.
A final Nomads short corner after sixty-five minutes led to a reversed hit which was deftly cleared by Parker through a forest of bodies but the last five minutes belonged almost entirely to South despite Hay being loaned on a ""free"" to the opposition. First Readman, in the immortal words of David Coleman, opened wide his legs and showed his class and then Agarwala and Taylor set up Barton, who got a good swing in but found the ball had perplexingly altered its co-ordinates before the stick-head could catch it. He soon tested the goalie with a good strike from a Fleck pass, though, but Murray put the rebound just wide. Taylor then also forced a save and Lewis was again in the thick of the action, nearly converting the rebound and afterwards racing back to tackle robustly when the home D was exposed. Bailey made a last-ditch sweep away when in mortal peril (honourably trusting to his stick skills rather than resorting to a well-concealed emergency whistle) and an uncompleted final assault by Murray and Taylor left honours even on the day.
A 1-1 draw was a reasonably fair result on the whole and, though Nomads weren't sleighed, at least it didn't rain, dear (groan!).","Men's 1sts drew with Cambridge Nomads 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

South started the game brightly when James Pope, making his debut from the team following elevation from the Thirds, chased down a loose ball in the D, work himself a bit of space, and crashed home from close range to give South an early lead.
Ely had began the game a man down, but even the arrival of the rest of their side, including their regular goalkeeper, did little to affect South's control of the game. Andy Bleach, donning the pads for the first time this season, would report at half-time that he had had only one save to make and that from a short.
South best attacks continued to revolve around Popey, with one typically coruscating run seeing him drive unluckily against the post, another seeing him crudely tripped when bursting through, which might in a league game have produced a penalty-flick, before a he added a deserved personal and team second shortly before half-time. Johnny B picked up the ball deep in his own half, one inch from the touchline, and proceeded to drive up that line, beating three men, always maintaining the same miniscule distance in play, before centring for James. From there Popey beat his man-marker, knocked it past a further defender and joyously nutmegged the keeper. Great goal.
Ely came out far stronger in the second-half, following the introduction of a talented young player. Continually feed the ball by his father in the Ely reargaurd, his direct running was creating problems in the previously imperious South defence. Following a Bleach save of one of his shots, he lifted another attempt goalwards, only for Jan Brynjolffssen to knock the chest high ball away and behind. Johnny B soon followed with a goalline clearance of his own, coming off the post to close down and block after the ball had been worked past Bleachy. The home umpire then got in on the act, whistling for a short corner mere nanoseconds before an Ely forward swept a loose ball home.
South were continuing to look dangerous on the counter, mainly through Popey, with one swept shot going just wide after a Benedikz-like break up the touchline by captain for the day, Stuart Creed. However, Ely were the team more likely, and with fifteen minutes left, they struck twice within two minutes to bring the game level. First a short corner was switched back to the right, where a clean shot was put into the corner, and then a fast break from midfield saw the forward get in behind the South defence, from where he placed an excellent reverse stick shot past an exposed keeper.
Further Ely pressure saw a third goalline clearance by South, this time Paul McIlwaine getting his stick up to knock an effort that was top-corner bound over the bar. Despite breaking out to exert some good pressure of our own in the final couple of minutes, the end of the game came as a something of a relief to South, though with our utter dominance of the first half the draw was a fair result.
Also special mentions to Rob Garrett, impressive in the midfield on his return debut following four years at uni, and to Andy Bleach for a number of important saves during the second period.

On the way up, the driving rain and high winds plus the news on the radio of various groups of soft professional footballers opting for a quiet day by the fireside had some worried about the fixture's chance of going ahead. Not Sanjay, however, who slept soundly for almost the entire journey. He had missed the last train back from London and ended up in a sleeping bag on an extremely hard floor. At least, that was the excuse
On arrival in Lynn it was soon clear the match would go ahead, as the rain stopped almost on cue. South took the change in the weather as a sign that their fortunes were generally improving and once again set about dominating a first half. This pressure soon lead to a lead when South's first short corner provoked a goalmouth scramble from which Dan Adlington's shot was kicked away from off (behind?) the line. The Pelicans player, exemplifying the spirit the game would be played in, owned up to his offence, and Rob Barton neatly put the penalty flick in the bottom right of the goal.
South continued to push on before the interval as the defence superbly marshalled by former Pelican, Matt Murray, didn't let a single direct shot at Andy Bleach, once again in the pads.
As last week, half time saw a change around in the balance of the match. Pelicans began to move the ball around with greater purpose and at times South's fitness began to flag as the ten men attempted to cover the spaces left. However, South were still creating good chances of their own, especially when one fine bit of interplay down the right between Dan Adlington, Sanjay Agarwala and Jonny Tostevin saw Danny worked into a clear goalscoring position. Unfortunately his shot was skewed wide. Another close thing came when a short corner was driven to just wide of the left post from where captain John Greaves (hobbling on manfully despite a sprained ankle from early in the match) just failed to convert.
However, Pelicans' play, backed by the strong wind, saw them penetrating more often into South's D, drawing a number of important saving tackles from Matt Murray and Rob Barton. This pressure resulted in an equaliser when a quickly taken free hit inside the twenty-five caught South napping, allowing an unmarked forward to sweep home.
Inside the last ten minutes South's fitness was really suffering and the shape of the team was lost. Pelicans took advantage to net a second when a short corner routine broke off a defensive foot (""broke off"" as in deflected, not as in detached) to an unmarked forward. His shot through legs beat the unsighted Bleach for a barely deserved winner.
Pelicans were forgiven their win though, on account of the excellent post-match grub (spaghetti bolognese, loads of garlic bread, fresh tea and mince pies), and the friendly manner in which the game had been played. A good work out before the Christmas season kicks-in.

Dan Adlington then got in on the act in a big way with his first hat trick for the club. His first was a solo effort, nutmegging the keeper confidently; the second was a result of good positioning and some classy work by Matt Murray to cross to him waiting on the penalty spot; his third was a re-run with another Murray cross buried coolly. Skipper John Greaves got another shortly before this one by loitering with intent close to the near post as a Lewis shot from his corner hit had come back off the keeper.
Stevenage were not totally outclassed however and the CSHC defence played solidly throughout, particularly Rob Garrett at sweeper who was faultless in an unaccustomed position and deservedly shared the MoM spoils with goal hero Adlington. Matt Murray rounded off the first half with a trademark mazy dribble and a double shot - the first having been stopped.
Stevenage came back in the second half, helped by masterful goalkeeping from guest Tim Poole, and CSHC were only able to add one further goal. This came from, who else, Adlington, who picked up the pieces from another short corner to cap a great performance for him and the team as a whole.

242,"10/01/2004","Friendly",1,58,"TBC",0,"Away","2","2","","","False","False","False","South prepared themselves for the second half of the league season with an excellent work-out against well-matched opponents who ran hard up front and continually created problems with imaginative passing and strong breaks. Indeed, Kettering's sharpness brought its reward as early as the second minute when, with the South defence struggling to find its feet, an unmarked forward found his way to the centre spot and converted a rapid cross with a well-angled touch into the corner which gave the diving Steve Parker little chance.
Parker then had to pull off a quick save from another goal-bound shot before South finally managed to penetrate Kettering territory and win a short after thrusting work from John Taylor on the right wing and Rob Barton in the middle. From Chris Massey's forceful push out, Rob Sprawson switched the ball to Barton, who manoeuvred himself neatly to strike the equaliser past an apparently unsighted goalie in the fifth minute.
A further short, this time driven in by Sprawson, was pushed away for a long after which the game moved evenly to and fro, with Andy Rose putting in his usual tigerish performance at left midfield and Jim Thorpe resolutely plugging the occasional defensive hole created by Kettering's front four. Massey's excellent control in the centre, allied to strong running from Barton and the selfless Sanjay Agarwala, gave South some impetus but there was perhaps not quite enough concerted support to put the home defence under real pressure.
Kettering, by contrast, always looked dangerous going forward and created two or three openings for clear shots but these were either off target or diverted wide. South were not helped by a finger injury to reliable centre-back Rob Hay, who was forced to sit out the rest of the game, but newcomer Vijay Agarwala, despite little recent practice, quickly made his mark with some precise tackling allied to good distribution.
As the half drew to a close, South won a little more possession and began to dominate up the left, where Massey provided the trigger for a classic one-two between Barton and Rose before the former just failed to connect with an insightful through ball. Thorpe then skilfully defused a further Kettering rush before Rose and Sanjay Agarwala forced a third short, which was slapped hard by Sprawson but well saved by the home keeper.
Kettering started the second half with renewed vigour, twice testing Vijay Agarwala at the back but he proved equal to the task, once clearing deftly for brother Sanjay to thread a forty yard pass through to Barton, who came agonisingly close with a tangential half-dink which nearly wrong-footed the goalie. The home team raced straight back though, slicing through the South defence to create a gilt-edged opening but keeper Parker coolly dispossessed the attacker with a diving block and a one-handed sweep away to the wing. A superbly supple right-footed stretch prevented another almost certain goal from short range moments later and a hectic few minutes for the skipper was then concluded when he made an excellent stick save from a rasping Kettering short.
Thorpe and Jonny Tostevin stoutly resisted further incursions and the game swung slightly in South's favour after a home defender gave the ball away with an over-ambitious backpass and a rich Scots expletive. Sanjay Agarwala raced away and, though just failing to find Barton with his cross, went on to create mayhem in the left-hand corner before pragmatically winning a free hit off an errant defensive foot.
Meanwhile, Tostevin had nearly made the breach with a delicious feint and a silky run up the inside-right channel and the umpire had yellow carded the noted Kettering bad boy for one theatrical laugh too many. This merely seemed to galvanise the home team, though, and after drawing a good left-footed kick from Parker, they managed to force a cross through the D for an unmarked attacker to slot home on the far post.
Despite determined attempts from Massey to get forward, Kettering continued to press and should have extended their lead on a big breakaway after fifty-one minutes but, though rounding an exposed Parker, they were unable to pass Vijay Agarwala, who covered heroically and made a crucial intervention inches from the line. The resulting short petered out and another, two minutes later, was confidently beaten away by Parker. Inexplicably, the return to action of the Kettering miscreant prompted an upturn in South fortunes and Taylor came into his own on the right, eating up large chunks of ground to batten on to a feed from Barton and roof the ball via the goalie's pads from a cunningly-lifted drive.
Both Barton and Taylor continued to force the pace in the final ten minutes and Sanjay Agarwala, bravely defying cramp and a recent stomach bug, ran persistently but the home side overcame some jittery defensive moments to set up several late attacks. Left back Rob Garrett, growing in assurance and confidence as the game progressed, and Vijay Agarwala were to the fore in breaking these up and there was also the wondrous experience of hearing Jim Thorpe offering strong moral uplift over a distance of seventy yards and then seeing him beat three men with what looked suspiciously like an Indian dribble from behind his own twenty-five.
Two last-ditch shorts for Kettering proved fruitless, with Garrett and Vijay Agarwala well out to one and Parker, unfazed by a neat switch and racing swiftly out to his left, putting in a great block to save the other. The final attack belonged to South but the whistle came just as Taylor was (surely?) about to sprint fifty yards into the D and bury the winner. Nevertheless, a draw was a very fair result, especially as South were not at full strength, and there was the added bonus of seeing the ever-inventive Chris Massey deliver a fearsome (if unintentional) hip-check that would have done credit to Wayne Gretzky.
South now look forward to the second half of the league campaign and earnestly hope that their opposition will provide no surprises as nasty as Kettering District Council's artfully-camouflaged speed bumps to throw them off course.","Men's 1sts draw with Kettering 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Although CSHC started with ten men, goal king Dan Adlington grabbed an early goal out of a goal mouth melee through his persistence in forcing the ball in after the defence repelled his initial shots.
Soon after goalkeeper Poole saw some unexpected action as he and sweeper Rob Garrett clashed, leaving him with a cut lip and broken tooth. Bloodied but unbowed, Poole carried on with his usual dominant display. Eleventh man Matt Murray then arrived, having travelled in especially from London, and announced his presence with a brace of goals; his first a spectacular solo effort involving his trademark reverse stickwork followed by a rasping hit from a well worked Greaves-Korstanje-Murray short corner move.
The goals continued to flow and two more were added before half time, from James Pope with a dazzling solo run through most of the Letchworth defence and then from another well-worked short corner routine, with Korstanje firing the ball to John Greaves lurking by the near post after taking the corner to drag it back and push it coolly into the net.
After half time Letchworth scored a surprising goal as the undermanned home defences were caught napping, but South were soon back in the groove with yet another variation on their short corner routine. This time it was Greaves to Murray to Greaves then across to the grateful Andy Lewis waiting by the penalty spot to slot the ball home. Vincent Korstanje grabbed a seventh with a straightforward blast from the top of the D off another short, then Lewis started and finished a great move up the whole pitch involving Murray and Adlington, ending with a cracking shot giving the keeper no chance. Just before this, Poole was called upon to save a penalty, which he did..as we knew he would.
Still the goals kept coming, as South continued to attack skilfully and sensibly, using all the team well. Adlington got his second from a pinpoint (editorial licence - Ed) Greaves cross picking him out in front of an empty net, and then Greaves had the final touch of the game by turning a long range Mark Jackson effort goalwards to get the home side into double figures.

A 1-0 victory over opponents who were mostly on the back foot provided some exercise but was little consolation for losing the opportunity to open the post-Xmas account with three points. A rearrangement necessitating a further journey up the A1 awaits.
For the record, South's goalscorer was Rob Barton, who left the Town goalie defenceless with a subtle deflection from Rick Erlebach's hit in. Highlight of the day, though, was Chris Massey's attempted impersonation of Torvill and Dean in Tesco's car park. A graceful slide and halt ended ignominiously when he collapsed under the weight of his own hockey bag and ended theatrically horizontal to prolonged applause.

The home team started purposefully, with good passing moves through all routes. This was rewarded by an early goal from the lively Dan Adlington. He took the ball into the opposition D with Creed acting as decoy and, after his first shot came back off the keeper, made no mistake with the rebound.
South dominated the rest of the first half, but were caught napping by a St Neots free hit which went to an unmarked forward, who skillfully flicked the ball over the otherwise immaculate Tim Poole in goal.
Apart from this the home defence had a firm grip, with Andy Bleach constantly turning defence into attack with well timed tackles and forceful runs and Rob Garrett his usual quick thinking and impassable self at sweeper. South grabbed the lead once more immediately before half time as a typical Korstanje thunderbolt from a short corner was blocked only for the lurking Greaves to snaffle the ball up and slot it into the net from close range.
Although South continued to dominate possession, St Neots started to come back into the game, and equalised again from a short corner with a hard shot giving the unsighted goalkeeper no chance. But the home team wouldn't give up, and got a deserved winner ten minutes from full time as Matt Murray snuck in and prodded the ball into goal from a yard or so after a frantic melee.
Everyone played well, individually and as a team, but Dan Adlington got the Man of the Match honours for his confident display leading the forward line, looking dangerous whenever he got the ball, which was often.

The start of the game was scrappy from both sides. This improved quickly although Ely took charge and most of the play was in the South half. In what became a blueprint for their later goals, Ely scored their opener after just ten minutes. The ball was fired into the circle and although keeper Will Benedikz stopped the initial shot an Ely player was on hand to tuck the ball away, despite the attentions of Rod Richardson standing on the line.
Going a goal down seemed to improve the South play and the basic hockey was looking much stronger. Attacks down the right wing through Phil Smith and Finn Johnson, supported by Rob Barton, looked to be South's best option for redressing the balance. However, Ely beat the South back line of Andrew Leonard, John Benedikz and Ky Ho to take to another half-chance.
Throughout the middle period of the half South were much more positive and they were attacking well on all fronts, forcing the Ely midfield and defence to work very hard. South were passing well to each other and running in support and this hard work nearly paid off as they won a number of penalty corners and also hit the post during a frantic few seconds as the ball was lost in the melee of players. James and David Bridge in midfield, supporting Wilco Dijkstra down the left wing, proved to be somewhat a thorn in Ely's side.
As things were going well for South disaster struck with two quick Ely goals just before halftime. Substitute Daniel Raffle certainly stopped it being three with a timely tackle immediately before the whistle even though he was heavily outnumbered.
The second half can be summarised by saying Cambridge were four goals down and pushing forward whilst Ely had a comfortable cushion and could afford the luxury of having a single striker sitting forward. Most of the goals came from a loose ball in the circle not being cleared fast or far enough by South. One example of this was when two shots were charged down at the edge of the circle only for the ball the ricochet to an Ely forward for another attempt.
The home side had an unrehearsed short corner routine that usually allowed the South defence to clear. John Benedikz and Ky Ho running out were particularly effective at spoiling these shooting chances. Only once, with a low flick, did Ely score cleanly. Luck too, played its part with one speculative (off target) shot being deflected in by a defenders foot.
Ely did not have the game all their own way. Cambridge continued to work very hard and looked like scoring. Shots and crosses came in from both sides but it was the final touch that was missing; on one occasion even when the cross had beaten the keeper. The forward players, Finn and Wilco, never gave up running and Finn's persistence, strongly supported by Phil Smith and Rob Barton from midfield, set up Rob on a run across the D to draw the keeper and shoot into the gaping net. This, despite having fifteen minites to play, was the final goal of the game. South's dedicated defending and persistent attacking could be summed up as they successfully defended a dead time penalty corner even though the entire Ely team were surrounding the circle.
The scale of the defeat is upsetting however the positive play, especially during the middle of the first half and the final quarter of the game is very encouraging. The (very) important games are now Peterborough, St Ives, St Neots and Long Sutton  all of whom we can beat (convincingly) if we pass and run as well as we can.

Deeping, level on points but with an inferior goal difference and having played a game more, made the early running and keeper Steve Parker was quickly into the action, sweeping away an awkward deflection for a long corner. After confident work by Chris Massey and Sanjay Agarwala on the left, Deeping surged forward again, only to be foiled by a classic Matt Readman tackle when two men were open. Jim Thorpe, too, was uncompromising and South gradually established a smooth passing routine round the back before the classy Vijay Agarwala held off two challenges to feed Rob Barton for a shot which was cleared.
On eleven minutes, though, the ever-inventive Rick Erlebach snapped a hit into the D from centre right and Sanjay Agarwala, with minimal space, expertly placed the ball under the left arm of the diving keeper to give South a crucial lead.
Further pressure from Rob Sprawson on the right wing, followed by an excellent link-up from Readman through Erlebach to Barton, threatened to increase the home side's advantage but Deeping defended coolly and gradually drove South back, forcing the first short corner of the game after eighteen minutes. This was well saved by Parker, who then had to block out a concerted attack before a second short was given. From this, Deeping equalised with a well-struck shot which dipped wickedly into the left-hand corner, and there was a further alarm two minutes later when a dangerous hit was sent across the face of the goal. Parker diverted it away with a diving stick save and Jonny Tostevin, a tower of strength throughout, cleared handsomely before another Deeping break was firmly stopped in its tracks by Erlebach.
Readman, who likes the going tough so he can get tougher, then put in a superb reverse-stick tackle before rescuing a disastrous-looking turnover with another consummate take. Meanwhile, Sanjay Agarwala, for the second time in the game, nearly intercepted a tantalising flat pass way back in the Deeping defence, and Massey set up Erlebach to deliver a great wrong-footing pass through to Barton.
Agarwala showed his zeal by racing back to help the defence just before half-time and Readman and Tostevin again fashioned a promising move up the right. But the half ended with Parker again being called on to clear and South feeling that, though they had played very well in patches, Deeping still had plenty of fuel left in the tank.
After the turn-round, South quickly took the initiative, with Chris Graveling seizing the ball off a Deeping forward and setting Readman off on a terrier-like run down the right. But the breakthrough came when Sanjay Agarwala and Erlebach combined to give super-sub Imran Tayabali just enough breathing space to unleash a split-second reverse shot which the Deeping goalie cleared high to concede a short. From Massey's feed, Sprawson controlled instantly, picked his spot and slammed home to make it 2-1 after thirty minutes.
Deeping almost immediately repaired the damage but once again foundered on a fine tackle by Parker who spread himself to form an impassable barrier. At a subsequent short, though, South were luckier to survive when a slick switch to the right post evaded the whole defence and was just diverted past the left, to a collective sigh of relief. Graveling then did well to secure a short at the other end after forty-four minutes and Sprawson, believing imitation to be the sincerest form of flattery, put in a switch of his own, which Massey just failed to get a stick on.
Deeping then set up another big run, bravely halted by Thorpe, before creating a gilt-edged chance in centre D, where a first-time strike was superbly kept out by Parker, who threw himself to his right and blocked before being pinned to the ground by the onrushing attacker. To general disbelief, a stroke was awarded but Parker, maintaining his focus, made an astonishing save by tipping the ball over the bar with his kicker while fully airborne. This spurred South on to renewed efforts up front and Tayabali, oozing class all the way down to his multi-coloured socks, tricked his way round several opponents to win South's third short of the half after forty-nine minutes. Sprawson's switch to Erlebach failed to bring dividends but Graveling, Massey and, in particular, Sanjay Agarwala all competed vigorously to keep the heat on. Tostevin and Sprawson combined well in the right corner but the resulting hit in seared straight across the goal untouched as the keeper did the splits.
Deeping struck back swiftly at this point, forcing the indomitable Parker into two more full-stretch tackles and a glove save as they burst clear, and Graveling had to put in the hard yards to manoeuvre the ball out to safety. After sixty minutes, however, Deeping equalised with a beautifully-taken first-timer into the bottom corner from an angled hit in.
The tempo then continued relentlessly as the visitors forced the pace and both Graveling and Readman had to be at their very best to prevent a further strike. Tayabali countered with a strong run up the right, then Massey sent Tostevin away with a visionary crossfield pass. Tostevin rushed the D, forcing a kick from the advancing keeper, and there were hopes of a late short when Sanjay Agarwala, buzzing furiously at the edge of the circle, appeared to be brought down but play continued and Deeping, as on several occasions, put up a good aerial ball which was safely dealt with by Thorpe before Readman again showed nerves of steel with a reverse-stick stop and cool clearance.
The excitement mounted in the closing moments as Deeping threw everything forward but Fortress Thorpe and the rest of the hard-worked defence were not to be breached. The whistle finally blew to end a pulsating seventy minutes and South, though slightly disappointed not to gain a bigger foothold over their nearest promotion rivals, were justifiably pleased that they were able to prevent them from making any headway.

Deeping snatched the lead when a shot bounced back luckily to the forward concerned to give goalkeeper Tim Poole no chance. The second goal soon after half-time was a result of an overdose of attackers in the CSHC D, which even the magnificent Rob Garrett at sweeper was unable to repel.
After that the away team tried manfully to get back into the game and even had two goals disallowed, the first from Dan Adlington, anxious to retain his mantle of CSHC Goal King, with a purposeful solo run and shot. The second came from a well worked Greaves-Lewis short corner routine, with John Greaves finding the net from close range. Sadly Deeping then got a third, with a speculative effort which ran straight through from outside the D with barely a touch.
CSHC did manage a consolation goal form Matt Murray, whose skill and persistance was rewarded with a trademark mazy run and shot over the befuddled Deeping keeper.
Overall the game was a good end to end tussle throughout, with much good passing hockey and positive play. CSHC never gave up the fight and looked at least the equal of the division's top team.

Of the eight goals conceded by Athletic so far, South have scored five and the other ten teams have managed just three between them in twelve games, which speaks volumes for South's attacking depth and never-say-die attitude. But despite hauling themselves back to 3-3 by half-time, South could not have survived without a superb defensive display in the second half, in which, backstopped by on-fire keeper Steve Parker, they successfully kept out seven shorts and two penalty flicks.
It was clear from the start that Athletic's front men, benefiting from early ball supplied by a hard-hitting defence and midfield, were going to cause big problems and Parker had already had to make three diving clearances before the five minute mark had been reached. Promisingly, though, Vijay Agarwala gave the Athletic defence pause for thought with a long run full of poise and power before his cross was cleared, and brother Sanjay again demonstrated why most teams have found him a handful on the left wing this season after being put away by a typically thunderous Jim Thorpe clearance.
Another well-worked manoeuvre linked through Chris Graveling and Rob Garrett showed South had some teeth and, on seven minutes, Rob Barton just missed the home goal after a feed from Sanjay Agarwala. However, the Athletic defence had little difficulty in penetrating the ring and, two minutes later, a cross from another burst up the right wing was only half blocked, leaving a well-placed attacker to punch the ball away from six yards.
Yet South, undaunted, bounced back immediately and, after a good run by Matt Readman, Rob Sprawson threaded a ball in from the right and Rob Garrett seized on a loose offering in the circle to slot home into the bottom corner as the goalie dived in vain. Athletic then won their first short, despite solid work at left defence from Vijay Agarwala, and a real stinger was well gloved down by Parker, who then swept to the right out of danger. On a second short two minutes later, Parker read the switch and made an excellent left-foot save and clear before an incoming Athletic forward undercut a fierce shot high into the net (and out through a hole in the back) to make it 2-1 after seventeen minutes.
At this stage, Athletic were knocking the ball long distances with ominous ease and control, and Thorpe and Readman had to work overtime to stem the tide. When Sprawson and Garrett finally managed to get some breathing space in the middle and put Barton clear, the latter was heavily legged up as a reminder that physique as well as skill was needed to make progress upfield.
Despite doughty work by the resilient Keith Simpson, Athletic won a third short on twenty-two minutes and Parker again thwarted a crafty switch with a big pad save. But he had little chance with the next short, when another clever shimmy to the left by the striker opened up a gaping hole gleefully exploited with a crashing shot to the backboard.
At 3-1 down after twenty-three minutes and with South struggling to get the play beyond their own twenty-five, things looked grim. Then Simpson was harshly called for a further short after another of Athletic's trademark crossfield hits, but South survived and Sanjay Agarwala made good ground with a teasing dribble on the left side before brother Vijay sent Graveling up the middle on a threatening run which ended in a well-disguised reverse-stick pass to Garrett. On this occasion, Garrett - a revelation on the right wing - shot wide but, after Parker had crucially tipped a rocket against the bar to save a fourth and possibly fatal goal, the league newcomer used his obvious pace and long reach to create panic in the Athletic defence. First, he forced South's first short following fraternal collaboration by the Agarwalas, and then, after Sprawson's big drive had been cleared off the line, he got into perfect position to touch Simpson's free hit into the bottom right-hand corner and narrow the deficit on thirty-two minutes.
Athletic threatened again with a direct run from midfield but Readman stuck to his man like superglue and ran him into a corner before prising the ball free and clearing. The clearance was snapped up by Sprawson, who drove forward up the right, and it was that man Garrett again who telescopically rounded the defence and pulled the ball back to Barton, who stuffed it home without frills to level the score at 3-3 a minute before half-time. So, barely five minutes after staring almost certain defeat in the face, South had clawed themselves back into contention and set up an enthralling second half.
After a rain-lashed team talk, South came out fighting, with Barton, Graveling and Sprawson all to the fore in advanced positions down the right wing. After Thorpe, Readman and John Benedikz - the latter showing particular coolness under fire - had worked the ball out of defence, the fleet-footed Garrett again eluded Athletic's back division and Sprawson won South's first, and last, short of the half after 38 minutes. His firm strike to the right post was stopped and kicked clear, though, and Athletic forced the ball downfield through a dangerously unchecked dribble to win the first of six shorts in a ten-minute spell which saw South constantly under the cosh. But keeper Parker brought all his long experience to bear at this critical stage, blocking a fierce drive from the first corner and diving brilliantly to his right to stick away the goal-bound follow-up for a long.
Simpson then made a key tackle on the edge of the D and Graveling toughed it out under a hail of pressure in the corner before Athletic worked it round the goal-line for another short. This time, Parker brought off a stunning airborne pad save from a real snorter and, moments later, nullified a dangerous switch play with a right-footed save and clear.
After a brief respite thanks to Readman and Simpson, Parker was again forced to clear with his stick before blocking a fourth short with the aid of Simpson on the line. The fifth and sixth shorts failed too, and Readman, Simpson and Graveling had just managed to gain a little possession when, in a sickening accident, the Peterborough captain broke his leg after falling awkwardly in a challenge just inside the D.
Following a subdued thirty minutes in which the emergency services attended, it was decided to continue the game and Parker was immediately faced with a penalty stroke which would return the lead to Athletic if they scored. But, as in the previous fixture between the teams, the South keeper was equal to the task and confidently beat away a hard rising shot after a flying dive.
Though Vijay Agarwala then found some open space on the left, a rapacious Athletic were soon back in the D and Parker reacted brilliantly to kick away a half-sighted deflection. Another dive and stick save was followed by a classic block from point-blank range; the ensuing scramble saw another penalty stroke awarded but this time Parker did not have to save as the taker over-compensated and hit the post to keep the score, almost miraculously, at 3-3.
Although beleaguered, South managed to get Sprawson free for long enough to set Barton up for a shot - which went just wide - on fifty-seven minutes, but the Athletic forwards closed in once more. Readman tenaciously diverted an angled attack into the corner, Benedikz tackled convincingly and Thorpe cleared with grim determination but Parker again had to be on his mettle to clear a reverse-stick shot. Readman, relishing the cut and thrust, released Barton to no avail but, moments later, the big forward made a determined run to beat the home keeper way out on the left and an upset goal suddenly looked on the cards. However, Athletic somehow cleared this, and another break from Sprawson, and homed in again on South's D.
The visitors' defence, though at full stretch, conceded only one further short, in the sixty-fourth minute, when Parker made another top-class save from a rasping lifter and Simpson coolly swept the rebound out to the wings. Parker was still not finished, having to kick away another reversed hit in the sixty-seventh minute, and South even managed to escape the yoke long enough for Garrett to threaten victory with another pacy right-wing run two minutes from time, but the whistle eventually blew to end a breathless and, amazingly, goalless second half, giving South a point that may well be crucial in the long run.
Although under severe pressure from a very strong Athletic side for much of the game, the whole South team, and particularly the defence, showed great mental resolve and composure, especially in the second half, and were never afraid to counter-attack even when the match seemed almost beyond them; the attitude remained positive throughout, with encouraging contributions from everyone on the pitch. This was a result from which South could take great heart, and it is to be hoped that the same level of commitment and fortitude can be maintained over the next two, critical, months.

South arrived with a strong team, including Rob Barton, Rob Garrett and acting captain John Benedikz, fresh from their match with the first team.
The match started with neither team really getting to grips with the other. The ball was swept rapidly from end to end, and the defences of both sides were put under pressure. It was March who broke the deadlock after twenty minutes with a scrappy goal shovelled home from close range after the South defence failed to clear the ball. Switching Will Marston to centre back and Rob Garrett to centre mid led to South showing more attacking flare and being more solid at the back. Rod Richardson and Daniel Raffle completed the South defence, with Rod especially playing a solid game.
Jack Chalk, playing during a temporary return from university, proved to be a handful for the March defence and on several occasions sprinted down the wing and took the ball into the circle. This led to confusion amongst the otherwise disciplined March defenders, but alas neither strikers Barton or Shantanu Golar could prod the ball home. These pull backs onto the penalty spot were some of the best scoring opportunities South managed and had they been converted the game would have been very different.
Throughout the first half especially, James Bridge was the outstanding South player with his dedicated talking and fierce attacking play he supported the team and dominated the area around him.
South's best chance occurred when a ball through the middle found Rob Barton who having beaten the defence rounded the keeper only to be cynically tripped by the beaten man. Having won the resulting penalty flick Barton stepped up to take responsibility took the flick and placed it carefully four yards wide of the post. March scored their second just moments before the half time whistle.
Riding on a high after taking a reasonable, and slightly undeserved, lead into the second half March turned on the pressure. Within seconds of the restart March caught the defence napping and scored a simple goal. As the fourth goal went in South's heads went down and cracks in the team began to show. Fitness also played a part as gaps appeared between the hardworking midfield and stretched defence. March made use of their youth by using young fit players to take the ball down the wings and avoid the strength of the centre of South defence. This tactic was successful with the simple pull back and back post shot working well on a number of occasions.
Despite being down South continued to attack and Finn Johnson, who played another good game at right mid, continued to drive into the March circle.
Ultimately six second half goals flattered March however they had managed to do the basics, passing and supporting each other, well.
Honourable mentions go to messrs Chalk, Barton, Benedikz and Garrett. Chalk for regularly getting round the back of the March defence and Barton and Garrett for doubling up after the toughest first team game of the season.","Men's 3rds thrashed by March Town 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0
253,"07/02/2004","League",1,121,"TBC",0,"Home","3","0","","","False","False","False","After the thrills and spills of the previous two weekends, South put in a workmanlike performance against St Ives 3rds at Hinchingbrooke School to gain their first league victory of 2004. Matt Murray, Vincent Korstanje and Jan Brynjolffssen, the latter two making their first-team league debuts, replaced Messrs Garrett, Sprawson and Benedikz on the right as South once again had to cover for multiple absences.
It was Murray, purposeful as ever in the front row, who was quickest to make his mark when creating space for Sanjay Agarwala to shoot after a fifth minute penalty corner won through the efforts of a keen-looking Matt Readman. Agarwala shot wide on this occasion but, five minutes later, Readman made a second aggressive run up the inside right channel before finding Rob Barton, who had earlier caused consternation in the St Ives defence with his well-practised reverse hit. Here, Barton held it up teasingly and then laid off a wide pass to the hard-running Korstanje, who finished the move well by beating the young St Ives keeper with a perfectly-timed strike.
South generally retained good control over the next quarter of an hour, with Action Man Readman influential in most areas of the field and the Agarwala brothers prominent both on the left and further in. St Ives's only short corner of the half fizzled out quickly and the defence was not unduly troubled, with the perennially efficient Jim Thorpe very much his perennially efficient self and Jan Brynjolffssen playing a sound positional game on the right.
A rare foray upfield by Thorpe resulted in a South short after thirty-two minutes and, after taking an accurate feed from Chris Graveling, Vijay Agarwala delivered a beautifully camouflaged switch pass to Matt Murray, who made good use of the time and space available to pick his spot and make it 2-0. Brynjolffssen then snuffed out a dangerous attack by astutely covering on the left and putting in a deft reverse-stick tackle as a St Ives forward teed it up in the D. However, despite powerful runs from Korstanje and Murray, there was no further scoring before half-time.
South upped the pace immediately on the restart, with Readman working a neat one-two with Brynjolffssen and Vijay Agarwala spreading the ball around confidently and Barton unleashed a salvo of shots and deflections which the St Ives defence did well to keep out. Sanjay Agarwala then beat two men comfortably on the left before discovering he'd overrun the (admittedly rather faint) sideline by at least six feet. When another sublime run took him several yards into touch, Master of Symmetries Jim Thorpe was prompted to offer the timeless advice: ""Make for the middle of the field, Sanj, it's safer there!""
By way of example, the avuncular sweeper immediately intercepted a dangerous pass and set off on a dead straight run upfield, tanking on until glory beckoned near the edge of the opposition D. Sadly, Thorpe's name was not to appear on the scoresheet this time, but South kept the pressure up and St Ives' willingness to get forward, though occasionally allowing them to put some awkward crosses in, frequently left gaps in the midfield which Readman, Graveling and the Agarwalas were quick to exploit.
South's third short of the game came after fifty-two minutes when, after a saving tackle by the gritty Keith Simpson in the left corner, Vijay Agarwala and Readman swiftly funnelled a move out to Murray on the right. This time, Agarwala elected to strike and, though the ball refused to sit up nicely and was going wide, Korstanje made a valiant effort to tip it in and only just failed. Thorpe then put in a crunching tackle to break up a St Ives attack before setting in train an excellent five man move full of simple passes and good support work. After more tricks of the trade from the elusive Readman, who gave several opponents the slip with his characteristic corkscrew cut-and-run, St Ives managed to rag the play into the South D and gain a short by ""persuading"" Graveling to overbalance and lie on the ball. The resulting clean strike was well saved by keeper Steve Parker and, though the ball agonisingly ran clear, St Ives missed the opportunity to bring the game back within reach by following up wide.
At the other end, Murray put a switched short just past the left hand post with a neat first-timer and then Korstanje and Murray set Graveling up for a bullet-like drag-flick which was unluckily prevented from arriving at its deserved destination by a defender's shoulder. With ten minutes to go, Sanjay Agarwala came off worst in a clash of heads with a St Ives defender and ""blood replacement"" Kevin Pride - who had come to umpire but found himself surplus to requirements - seized his chance and donned a green shirt before haring off up the left wing.
South kept their two goal lead intact through super defensive work by Simpson - stick low in the tackle as demonstrated in the Rob Sprawson Coaching Video - and almost scored when Pride latched onto a cross from Readman after excellent approach play by Korstanje. Barton, running tirelessly as usual, then got in a hard reverse-stick shot at short range before Pride stole the show on sixty-seven minutes, accepting a switch from Vijay Agarwala at South's sixth penalty corner and belting a cracker straight past the St Ives goalie. The gamekeeper-turned-poacher then completed a highly entertaining cameo by putting in a magnificent fifty yard run into the left corner in anticipation of another defence-splitting pass. The final whistle slightly spoiled the party but there was no doubting the day belonged to the Pride of Cambridge South.","Men's 1sts beat St Ives 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

The inevitable happened when St Ives got a breakaway goal after twenty minutes. South didn't give up and were rewarded right at the end of the first half when John Greaves managed to tuck the ball away from his customary two yards after James Pope evaded the advancing defence to cross following a short corner.
The pattern continued in the second half, with most of the pressure coming from the away team and a number of good short corners, which nearly all provided shots. Sadly both Creed and Lewis were repeatedly unlucky to see their efforts whistle past the post, or be blocked by the giant St Ives keeper. Andy Lewis eventually got a deserved goal with an unstoppable shot rocketing into the net from another short corner.
Unfortunately South were unable to hold on to the lead and St Ives got another breakaway goal past their remodelled defence to equalise. The game ended with both sides seeking a winner and South in particular had further chances but had to be content with a draw to cement their position just behind the leading pack of 5NW.

South fielded almost the strongest side their squad allowed and from the starting whistle they looked sharp and committed, wrestling the ball away from the Peterborough players. South pushed forward from the start and their wingers created several good chances. South continued to look most dangerous when they got the ball wide to Finn Johnson and David Bridge, whose crosses caused constant confusion in the opponents D. Nick Wong marked his return to the 3rds with a tireless display of running, and was a constant threat to the opposition.
Although caught on the back foot, Peterborough always looked dangerous and keeper Will Benedikz was required to make one saving by diving at the feet of the oncoming striker. A second goal chance was narrowly missed when Peterborough shot high and wide after an inventive short corner routine.
South dominated the first half and their much-deserved goal eventually came via a short corner. Lacking their regular short corner striker, John Benedikz stepped up and, despite mis-hitting the ball so it only bobbled into the area, the ball was swept home past a stranded keeper by ever-predatory striker Jack Chalk. South continued to press for the remainder of the half and despite winning more short corners and creating several shots on target failed to increase their lead.
The second half started as the first had with South charging to the attack. The ball was collected by CM Andy Kennedy and moved down the right hand side through James Bridge, David Bridge and Wilco Dijkstra. Within thirty seconds South had won a free hit on the edge of Peterborough's D which was driven in with much more power then finesse by Benedikz before being touched on by Chalk and ultimately knocked into the goal by a Peterborough player.
At two-nil up South started to cruise and lost concentration a little and Peterborough showed strength by taking the opportunity to come forward. Although having more of the ball in this period, Peterborough could not make inroads into the South D. The back line of Ky Ho, Will Marston, Andrew Pounce and John Benedikz kept most of what came at them away. When they did get through the defence, keeper Will Benedikz came out, and although the ball was lifted over the on-rushing keeper, he managed to deflect it on to the post.
Peterborough's only goal came from a similar position as South's second. Following a string of short corners and free-hits from just outside the circle, one ball was touched into the D from a free hit and smashed past the unsighted keeper.
Conceding a goal jolted South back to life and midfield pairing, James Bridge and Andy Kennedy, regained control and spread the ball down the wings through Dijkstra, Wong and Johnson. These crosses caused more confusion, despite the aggressive play of the Peterborough keeper, and centre forward Shantanu Golar was unlucky not to score when he struck the post. During the last five minutes South tired and Peterborough came forward again. Several shots were sent in on the South goal, to be confidently cleared by Benedikz (W). Peterborough also tried crosses which caused much confusion, but could not find their way past the defence, led by Benedikz (J) who showed a surprisingly cool head in taking his time to clear several loose balls to safety.","Men's 3rds beat Peterborough Town 5","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0
256,"14/02/2004","League",1,54,"TBC",0,"Away","2","1","","","False","False","False","In a seesaw game which both teams could have won, South defied further absences and injuries to edge past a very determined Horncastle outfit whose recent results belie their lowly position in the table.
The home side started menacingly, creating plenty of space in the South defence and as early as the fourth minute won a short corner which was superbly kept out by Steve Parker as he stacked the pads. Chris Graveling and Keith Simpson then cleared effectively, sparking a series of attacks from South in which the dynamic Rick Erlebach and Sanjay Agarwala were prominent. Agarwala, extending his range, put in a tumbling reverse-stick sweep from left D which forced the home keeper into a diving save, and moments later created havoc with a powerful dribble, beating off three strong challenges before finally being baulked.
But it was Erlebach who drew first blood on twelve minutes when, from South's first short, he struck a sweetly-timed shot with millimetric precision into the far corner, the ball pinging in off the post to clatter resoundingly against the metallic backboards. South's joy was only temporary, however, as Horncastle surged forward and, thickly populating the visitors' D, made the most of some questionable marking to bundle the ball home for an equaliser after fourteen minutes. They nearly had another golden opportunity three minutes later as a huge space suddenly opened at the back with two attackers free but Parker was alert to the danger and raced out to kick clear from the edge of the D in the nick of time.
Rob Barton carved out a great run down the middle to put the pressure back on the home side, who shrugged it off to win a second short which they placed just wide from a mistimed drag-flick. Jan Brynjolffssen, who had done a sensible job on the right in demanding circumstances, then pulled a thigh muscle, opening the way for Louis Polet to make his first-team debut. The game continued to fluctuate, with a further South attack sending the ball whizzing past an upright before Jim Thorpe saved the day at the other end with two last-ditch tackles. Horncastle then sent a cross straight through the D and, after a long corner was cut out, Erlebach fought tigerishly in the corner, releasing a pass to Graveling, who sent Barton clear to test the keeper.
South were starting to look dangerous at this point and, though Polet was unable to make a dream start by getting a stick to a loose ball near the spot with the keeper out of position, he soon cleverly won a short after an incisive wing pass from John Benedikz. The home side repelled this despite strong work from Vijay Agarwala and Barton and soon turned the tables with their third short after thirty minutes. A neat switch move opened up acres of room for a free shot but Parker, with the odds well against him, rushed out to narrow the angles and, diving, got enough pad on the ball for the impressively calm Benedikz to knock the resulting lob down from his position on the line and away to Simpson, who was on hand to clear with his usual pragmatism. South made the most of this escape to push up and, on thirty-three minutes, they created a decisive advantage at just the right time when Erlebach's strike from a short led to a rebound which Barton rammed home with a minimum of ceremony for a 2-1 lead.
There was no slackening in the pace of the game after the interval and Thorpe immediately had to be at his best to repel boarders as Horncastle swarmed upfield, with their no. 9, a nifty dribbler, always causing problems with his willingness and ability to take the man on. But although South had difficulty in keeping Horncastle pinned down, they largely kept their composure, with John Benedikz applying sound defensive sense after Brynjolffssen, bravely trying to carry on after half-time, was eventually forced to retreat to the sidelines. Andy Pounce, too, stuck tightly to his man and, with Thorpe playing a blinder in the centre, there was room for Vijay and Sanjay Agarwala to work some worthwhile ball up the left and for the savvy Barton to hold things up while Agarwala (S) ran creatively to find an opening.
After forty minutes, Erlebach made his way into the D but the keeper denied him on this occasion, and again at a firmly-struck short two minutes later, before Horncastle, noisily urged on by subs and supporters, explored the wings and started peppering the D with shots and crosses. Parker had a busy few minutes at this point but kept South afloat with several safe kicks which defused the situation, while Sanjay Agarwala and Erlebach nearly made Horncastle pay for a giveaway with a blistering run which the home defence eventually did well to thwart.
On the right, Polet worked hard to make himself available, Benedikz tackled resolutely and with precision and Graveling managed to get in a tricky run along the back line but South appeared unlucky to miss out on one or two short corners after the tireless Erlebach had forced advantages. Still the deadlock could not be broken, even when Thorpe showed a touch of class by dribbling round three men out of defence, although the best chance fell to Horncastle when a cross from the right found two men free on the far post. But Parker's positioning was again immaculate as he first gloved the ensuing shot down and then cleared it to safety. A further dangerous-looking shot was deflected past the post after sixty minutes and, shortly afterwards, Simpson had to break up a speedy attack after Vijay Agarwala and Graveling had threaded their way through a knot of defenders into the Horncastle D.
More opportunities came in the next five minutes as first Erlebach was denied and then Agarwala and Graveling, again, combined to set up a diagonal ball well sticked away by the keeper. The direction of play continually reversed, with Thorpe and Simpson in particular standing firm against some very aggressive running and the Agarwalas bolstering the defensive effort with typical determination; a great run by Erlebach was followed by two massively important tackles from Simpson and a nerveless block from Thorpe and, to cap it all, Horncastle hit the post from a short corner after sixty-eight minutes. The ball rebounded into play but the home forward put it agonisingly wide as Parker flung himself across to cover.
There was still time for Thorpe to set Sanjay Agarwala up for another lung-bursting run but Horncastle's desperate efforts to get the equaliser came to naught as the whistle blew to end a game which could have gone either way but which South gutsed their way through for an invaluable three points.
Skipper Steve Parker, having delivered a rackety team talk to little more than half a side at the start, ended the day a relieved man and very grateful to the hardy souls who had trekked through the Fens (or even further) to put up such a wholehearted and committed effort in the sort of game that could so easily have proved a stumbling-block.

A second goal followed soon after, with Jon Taylor scooping the ball in following a melee near the line. Andy Lewis got the third, taking a pass from the ever purposeful Stuart Creed, who was dominating midfield with Korstanje, to blast the ball in off the keeper.
At this stage South took the foot off the gas a little, allowing City to grab one goal back just before half time. This was somewhat fortuitous, as the shot was going well wide before it took a wicked deflection to evade the South keeper.
This gave City more confidence and early in the second half they grabbed another, with another deflection off an unfortunate defender. Keeper Tim Poole didn't allow these pieces of bad luck to distract him from another formidable performance as he prevented a number of shots with brave dives at the feet of City forwards.
Positional changes tightened things up for South and Jon Taylor got his second goal from another short corner, again from close in. Although City got a third goal, South made the match secure with skipper Greaves netting his second from the tricky two feet range, again off a short, with Taylor following up just too late to get what would have been a well deserved hatrick.

261,"21/02/2004","League",3,123,"TBC",0,"Home","4","0","2","0","False","False","False","Cambridge South continued their surge towards safety with a strong performance against fellow strugglers, St Ives. South, who earlier in the season had lost to St Ives 7-2, dominated for two thirds of the match in a performance that suggested that relegation is increasingly unlikely. The victory lifts them to within a point of St Ives.
Cambridge South attacked St Ives from the starting whistle, immediately driving them back into their own half. Despite constant pressure so that St Ives could not cross their own twenty-five yard line, South failed to score in the first twenty minutes. Creditably, South were not frustrated by this and continued to search for weaknesses in the ominously solid St Ives defence. Strikers Wilco Dijkstra and Nick Wong causing particular trouble to the visitors. South's pressure paid off with time when they gained several short corners and it was from one of these shorts that South first scored. A well struck ball into the D by sweeper John Benedikz was magnificently swept home through the keepers legs by Nick Wong.
The second goal followed soon after, when a free hit was awarded on the top of the St Ives D. Keeping their heads South played the ball quickly into the area catching the keeper off guard and Nick Wong poked the ball home after the St Ives defence failed to pick up his darting run across the goalmouth. Two-nil nearly became three-nil when hardworking midfield dynamo Andy Kennedy picked the ball up on the St Ives twenty-five yard line and whilst running in, struck the ball on target. The thump of the ball on the backboard was enough to get South's keeper and captain Will Benedikz celebrating again, little realising that shot was from fractionally outside the area.
At 2-0 up South suffered a minor slump at the start of the second half and St Ives pushed forward against the South defence. South looked nervous despite being in control and it was clear that a goal for the visitors could open the door for them. St Ives had several chances to pull goals back, including a number of penalty corners, but found the South back line of Ky Ho, Will Marston and Andrew Pounce in a very determined frame of mind. Time and again South spoilt St Ives's short corners and limited St Ives to a single clear shooting opportunity, which was dragged wide. The defence's doggedness in clearing the ball set up a number of attacks. On the counter attack South looked very dangerous. Winger David Bridge had several strong runs from his own half and nearly set up Nick Wong twice, although the visiting keeper denied him. On the right, Rob Barton provided valuable and reliable relief for the defence as well as a dangerous point of attack down the wings.
James Bridge capped a fine individual performance in central midfield by scoring the side's third goal. This was another turning point in the game and South were again in the ascendancy. James's goal with about fifteen minutes to play killed off any chance St Ives had of salvaging points from the game. With the confidence of the goal behind them South resumed playing fluid hockey, attacking down both wings with equal confidence and torturing the visiting defence.
South's final goal, scored by Rob Barton, was made by more persistent play from the South's forwards. Rob reacted first to pounce on a rebound off the keeper and slot the ball home to wrap up a fine win.

Though missing Jim Thorpe, Veejay Agarwala, Keith Simpson and vice-captain Rob Barton from two weeks ago, South were pleased to welcome back Matt Readman in the heart of the defence and John Taylor, Rob Garrett and the evergreen Steve Fleck up front.
The opening exchanges were dominated by South, with midfield general Rick Erlebach right in the thick of things as the Spalding goalie was forced into two good saves following a second minute short corner. Erlebach quickly had his measure, however, when, in typical steel-wristed fashion, he whipped the next short cleanly into the bottom left hand corner to give South the lead after three minutes.
Galvanised, Spalding spread the ball around in midfield and, after Chris Graveling had calmly sold keeper Steve Parker a dummy and cleared with aplomb, they won a free hit which was fired in hard and trapped in the D. Parker made the save on the ground but an eager Spalding forward was on hand to knock in the loose ball for a seventh minute equaliser. Determined rescue work from Readman, twisting and turning out of trouble, and the solid John Benedikz prevented further incursions before Spalding broke clear down the right and, rather luckily, won a twelfth minute short as Parker brought off what appeared to be a perfectly-executed reverse-stick tackle to save an almost certain goal. Justice was done, though, as the Spalding skipper, always a menace before a leg injury restricted his participation later on, shot just wide.
In the fourteenth minute, South restored their lead when Fleck collected an Erlebach free hit from the top left and cleverly lured the Spalding keeper to his doom before setting up Taylor for an unopposed tap-in. Chances continued to flow thick and fast, with Fleck, Graveling and Garrett sorely troubling the home defence and Andy Lewis running hard from left wing to reach some excellent goal-scoring positions, but South were still forced to work hard at the back and, when Spalding found a man free on the far post, Parker instantly spotted the danger and defied him with another reverse-stick tackle. He then blocked a sweetly-struck home short stone dead before sweeping to safety and this presaged another South charge upfield, with Garrett roasting the defenders up the right and Taylor cracking a trademark first-timer straight at goal. Brave work from the home keeper stopped the rebound from close range and South were unable to capitalise on the resulting short corner despite a neat, space-winning jink from receiver Erlebach.
Spalding repeatedly thrust forward in numbers but, once again, the granite-hard Readman proved both a rock and a hard place, contesting every ball to the max and once sending a thwarted attacker spinning with an optimally-timed handbrake turn. After determined defensive work from Jan Brynjolffssen, who again played an impeccable positional game, the inspired Readman then put Fleck away for a defence-burning run that left him one-on-one with the keeper. Fleck feinted left but, at the last moment, laid the ball off rightwards to the onrushing Garrett, who escorted it safely into the unguarded net to make the score 3-1 after twenty-eight minutes.
Strong cover by Graveling and John Benedikz at the back, allied to stout, if unintentional, defensive interventions by various parts of Taylor's anatomy, slowed Spalding's attempt at a comeback, but they still won two short corners in quick succession. Parker dived athletically to stick away a screamer bound for the bottom corner and then Brynjolffssen alertly read a wrong-footing switch and was in perfect position to take the ball off the intended receiver homing in on the post. The rest of the half belonged entirely to South, with Garrett (twice) and Lewis both coming close following incisive runs by Fleck and the serpentine Erlebach, and Spalding owed their continued survival solely to the efforts of their now slightly overworked keeper.
South stepped up their quest for a killer fourth goal immediately on the resumption, with Garrett nearly reaching a through ball by virtue of his giraffe-like strides and Taylor using long-arm leverage to shoot as soon as the opportunity arose. Taylor then beat four men with a belligerent drive after Graveling had put in a consummate reverse tackle for Readman to clear. Moments later, Sanjay Agarwala, returning fresh after a bout of cramp in the first half, made a curving approach up the left and Fleck hit a carefully-weighted ball into the D which the goalie jumped over before turning in horror as Garrett raced through on the blindside and missed the conversion by a whisker. When Spalding threatened, Lewis weighed in on defence to retrieve the situation but he was soon back in position up front to latch onto a pass from Fleck when the latter again split open the home rearguard with a devastating solo burst. Taylor, Fleck and Garrett, profiting from Erlebach's distributive skills, continued to dominate the right flank and Agarwala was persistence personified in left midfield, regularly holding off his abrasive markers with deft stick control and always looking to get into open space. Brynjolffssen and John Benedikz both remained assured in defence and each came away calmly with the ball when facing critical head-to-heads.
By the fifty minute mark, Spalding had started to lose their composure, especially when Agarwala really got into his stride, but this merely served to fire up their goalie, who blocked an Erlebach shot and then made excellent tackles on Fleck and Garrett when they were clean away with the defence receding into the distance. Fresh legs were provided on fifty-five minutes by the versatile Will Benedikz, who had subbed for Agarwala on the left in the first half and who now gave brother John a well-deserved rest at right back, reminding all of his prowess from a previous incarnation with a completely authentic surge followed by a nonchalant reverse-stick stop. South's sixth short, on fifty-seven minutes, was blocked after Erlebach elected to flick and Taylor seized on the rebound and, shortly after, Graveling bamboozled five men in a dazzling run down the left. But despite apparently being on the ropes, the home side refused to throw the towel in and, with five minutes to go, they fashioned a dangerous move from centre midfield which saw the South defence turned for once. The obvious pass was whipped across to two men free halfway into the D and the situation looked ugly but Parker, advancing decisively, put in a beautifully-timed tackle to beat the ball clear.
South regained control through Agarwala and the torpedoes up the right but, even then, Spalding were not done. With a minute to go, they won a fifth short and, though this was convincingly suffocated by Parker, he could do nothing about its successor, which found its way into the left-hand corner courtesy of a sophisticated deflection. A Spalding equaliser at this stage would have been something of a travesty but, thankfully, there was time for little more than the obligatory push-back before the umpire blew to confirm one of South's most important victories of the season.
As a reward, half the South team were locked in the changing-room by the far from eponymous ""caretaker"" but, with typical resolve and ingenuity, a Great Escape was made by fenestral means well in time to join the post-match festivities. With Spalding defeated and facing a tough run-in, it now looks highly likely that the battle for second spot in the division will be between South and the persistent Deeping.
Skipper Steve Parker was delighted with his side's performance, to which all members of the travelling squad made a valued and valuable contribution. He was especially grateful to those members of the squad who ensured that his iconic kit would not be left to fester in a dank Spalding changing room.","Men's 1sts beat Spalding 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

South dominated from the start of the game and throughout the first half and fashioned a great number of excellent chances to score. The midfield of David and James Bridge, Andy (Kenny) Kennedy and Finn Johnson ran the ball into the opposition D, creating several chances. The first goal came via the stick of Wilco Dijkstra, who has scored at least once in all the games against St Neots (4 in total) this season. A strong run down the right hand side involving Kenny, Nick Wong and Finn was pulled back across goal for the ever-present Dutchman to sweep home. South's second goal came shortly after from a good strike by midfield dynamo James Bridge.
Despite scoring twice South had not looked at their best. However, from this point until half time continued to create chances and look equally as good as they have in their recent games. South used the run in and switch back to create at least three chances for various players but alas squandered these opportunities. They also created half a dozen first half short corners, but the short corner striker John Benedikz failed to make much impression on the defence.
St Neots came out to the second half fighting and initially South failed to really get to grips with the opposition midfield and forwards. This short period of play brought the defence of Ky Ho, Will Marston, Andy Pounce and sweeper John Benedikz properly into the game and game them some proper work to do. The settled back line controlled the situation with their regular composure, leaving keeper Will Benedikz with only a couple of shots to clear away.
South recovered from these early set backs to begin their best passage of play of the game. It was during this period that South were able to put the game well beyond St Neots. A close range shot from Nick Wong slipped past the keeper for three-nil. Within minutes South scored following perhaps their best move of the game. First half substitute James Pope launched a rapid counter attack and drove half the length of the pitch before selflessly passing the ball to Nick Wong who slipped the ball under the advancing keeper. Four-nil became five-nil when James Bridge added his second of the match. James' drive across the circle drew the keeper, who was wrong footed before James slotted the ball home.
South settled back after this and went a little quiet. Andy (Kenny) Kennedy, who had played a determined game throughout stopped two St Neots' clearances in quick succession. Unfortunately both of these were with his hand and he went off with what turnout out to be a double fracture the finger. Tragically for the team this is likely to end his playing for the season. Closely following Kenny off the pitch was the St Neots centre back who deflected a James Bridge shot onto his own eyebrow producing alarming quantities of claret. During this dormant period for South St Neots broke forward and won a short corner. The switch of strikers beat the onrushing defenders and the St Neots forward then wrong footed keeper Benedikz to score inside the right post. This was disappointing as the South defence were rock solid throughout.
As the match was drawing to a close Nick Wong picked up a ball cleared away from a short corner. Finn Johnson, who played probably his best game of the season, made an intelligent run wide and drew the defender out of Nick's path, allowing the South striker to beat the keeper at his near post, for his hat trick and South's sixth.","Men's 3rds whip St Neots 5","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0
264,"06/03/2004","League",1,66,"TBC",0,"Home","2","2","","","False","False","False","In a match rescued by David Bridge's willingness to step in as a last-minute umpiring replacement, South came face to face with the only team to defeat them thus far this season, the mercurial Long Sutton 3rds. Despite two recent heavy losses, Sutton have taken points off apparently much superior teams and are predictable only in their unpredictability. So there was a sense of unease when, within the first two minutes, Sutton's Antipodean left-winger made a speedy and virtually unchallenged run into the D and unleashed a powerful reverse-stick shot which keeper Steve Parker saved with characteristic alertness. However, as in the previous game between the sides, South conceded an early goal when a Sutton short corner was not fully cleared and the ball was blasted home from the edge of the circle past the unsighted Parker.
An equaliser seemed to be on the cards almost immediately, though, as good moves involving Rob Sprawson, Matt Murray and the consistently slippery Rob Garrett on the right and the Agarwala brothers on the left forced Sutton to pack the D and defend desperately. Yet, on ten minutes, South found themselves two down after Sutton, exploiting a seemingly innocuous position on the right, opened up space in the middle for their winger, who took an unexpected opportunity to roof the ball at a rate of knots.
In spite of these early setbacks, the home side were undaunted and quickly won a series of short corners. Striker Rick Erlebach was on target with three, all saved by the keeper, while Matt Murray's shot from a switch was cleared off the line. Catastrophe loomed at the other end when the hard-running Sutton forwards again carved out a clear-cut chance in the D but Erlebach, pulling his weight at both ends, leapt like a salmon to intercept a goal-bound flick on sixteen minutes. Within a minute, Sutton had the ball in the net again but eagle-eyed umpire Bridge had spotted a back-stick and South made good their escape through Matt Readman, Murray and Garrett.
A fifth short for South after twenty-seven minutes was reward for another looping Garrett run but both this and its two successors, flicks from Erlebach and Murray, were blocked. A further golden opportunity went begging as the ball raced across the face of the visitors' goal with the keeper otherwise engaged, but the finishing touch again eluded the South forwards, who also failed to make the most of a perfectly-angled left-wing cross from Sanjay Agarwala. Then a dubiously executed substitution by Sutton gave their left-winger a clear break into an untenanted corner and he took advantage to fire another lifted shot in the D; this time, though, Parker was able to race off the blocks and deflect the goalward strike with his upper body, leaving Keith Simpson to clear the soaring ball and avert further disaster. But South, despite winning their eighth short corner in just over twenty minutes, still ended the half 2-0 down.
Skipper Parker and an animated Rob Sprawson emphasised the need for cool heads, solid defence and teamwork and the second half started with South continuing to lay siege to the visitors' goal. Erlebach fed Sanjay Agarwala on the right post but the Sutton keeper, a big thorn in South's flesh in the previous encounter, made two resolute blocks before the ball finally went wide. Agarwala again, this time from Vincent Korstanje, and Murray both battled through grimly but no-one could land the killer blow until Garrett once more outpaced his marker to deliver the ideal cross, which a jubilant Erlebach put away under the diving keeper to reduce the deficit on forty minutes.
South continued to turn the screw, with Murray roaming widely in an effort to find a suitable site for an incision and Sanjay Agarwala making a thrilling right-angled run past four defenders to the goal-line before narrowly falling short with the equaliser in sight. Defensively, South found more cohesion in the second half and both Keith Simpson and Veejay Agarwala showed their mettle in the challenge. South won a ninth short after forty-six minutes but Erlebach's punchy on-drive was well sticked away by the goalie. After good work from the aggressive Readman and a tackle of surpassing resolution by Chris Graveling deep in his own right-hand corner, South drove relentlessly upfield through Erlebach, Garrett and Murray and, amidst a hail of bodies in front of goal, it was right-back Sprawson, capitalising on a flurry of shots from Garrett, who finally broke through the defensive shield to bring South level after fifty-two minutes.
The staggering energy of Erlebach continued to fuel South's momentum as the team's fluency increased, although Graveling was still needed to make two fantastic tackles to break down threatening attacks and Simpson had to sprint fifty yards to cover back on the right. A tenth South short after sixty-three minutes failed to sit up nicely for Erlebach and Sanjay Agarwala shot just wide, but there were more chances on offer after Veejay Agarwala burst through powerfully to set up Murray and Garrett.
The visitors defended resiliently, though, and continued to look potentially dangerous on the break. However, their left-winger had to be withdrawn for his own good after vociferously claiming to know more about the rules than the excellent Matt Bailey  who umpired with great tact, poise and reason as usual  and Sutton thus missed the opportunity to have heir strongest combination out for the last five minutes. Sanjay Agarwala again sizzled up the left to bring hopes of a late winner but, after the keeper had saved from both him and Murray, it was up to Veejay Agarwala and the rock-solid Simpson  again belying his unflappably calm approach with a flamboyantly piratical bandanna  to hold firm at the rear and help South to claim a share of the points against opponents who had once more proved to be an awkward proposition.
Skipper Steve Parker was disappointed with the loss of points but was keen to stress the importance of earning a draw. He was quick to point out that the team's next opponents, March, heavy scorers but leaky in defence, were likely to provide a sterner challenge than in the first half of the season and that, as ever, there would be no room for complacency.

The first half was fairly even, with the away defence, particularly the effective central pairing of Mark Jackson, and stand in sweeper Rob Barton, being unlucky to concede a scrambled goal. South did have their moments, with Stuart Creed and Tim Waller prompting many attacks and a number of short corners were won; these were well worked but not capitalised on.
The second half was, er, different. March got further ahead with a rapid double and this induced panic in the CSHC ranks. Two more goals were gifted to the by now dominant March team as South visibly tired, leaving keeper Will Benedikz unprotected all too often. The final goal was barely noticed as the renowned CSHC 2nd team competitive spirit drained away.
A bad day at the office, with the effects of double ups and general unfamiliarity arising from a scratch team, coming up against a good March team working together as a unit in front of their vocal supporters.

Cambridge South can consider themselves bitterly unlucky to have lost to a good Ely side despite controlling much of the game. In a closely fought contest it took a second half short corner to divide the two teams, who matched each other for the whole seventy minutes.
South took a little time to adjust to a slightly altered team which saw the replacement of Andy Kennedy (broken fingers) with Chris Clegg. During their period of adjustment South battled Ely through the midfield and matched them in all departments.
Chances were few and far between in the first fifteen minutes as neither team really made inroads into the others circle. It was fantastic to see South take control of the game as the half grew older and create some good chances. Both forward Nick Wong and Wilco Dijkstra had chances, although the best of which was a cross from the by-line that scooted across the face of goal but somehow evaded all the South sticks present.
Ely, who were obviously extremely worried by the quality of the South's play, stepped up a gear. In response the South defence of Ky Ho, Will Marston, Andrew Pounce and John Benedikz had to play some extremely good hockey to keep Ely out. Once again South's defence of short corners was outstanding and Ely were unable to shoot from any of their efforts. The visitors had a number of close range efforts which were goal-bound before being expertly saved by the keeper Will Benedikz.
David Bridge at left midfield played an excellent first half, proving to be a thorn in Ely's side, tackling tenaciously on the Ely twenty-five yard line and making strong attacking runs supported by his brother and Wilco. South continued to play solidly, making few mistakes, for the rest of the half.
Whilst still being a one of their best displays, South's second half performance was slightly inferior to their first half efforts. South's efforts were encapsulated by the hard work and commitment shown by the midfield of David Bridge, Chris Clegg, James Bridge, Ali Blake and Finn Johnson, who contested every ball despite carrying an injury. Most importantly the midfield kept going for the entire seventy minutes, providing extremely valuable cover for the defence as well as menacing the Ely back line.
South were finally broken down when a short corner was awarded midway through the half. Following Ely's only clean routine the first shot was stopped before the rebound was slipped past the prone keeper and pushed home from close range. Conceding the goal spurred South into greater efforts and Wilco Dijkstra and Nick Wong both came close, the former only prevented by a smart save from the Ely keeper.
The second half's comic moment was provided by keeper Will Benedikz who raced out of his D towards the corner flag to intercept a loose ball before carefully kicking the ball to a surprised sweeper John Benedikz. As both teams stopped the whistle failed to blow and John drove the ball away to safety. Despite further attacking play South failed to level the game and Ely were much relieved to have secured the points, against the general run of play.","Men's 3rds lose to Ely City 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0
267,"13/03/2004","League",1,69,"TBC",0,"Away","3","0","1","0","False","False","False","In a potentially difficult encounter against high-scoring March Town, South emerged worthy winners with a strong all-round performance which again demonstrated their flexibility in the face of enforced team changes. Missing regulars Keith Simpson (broken thumb), Sanjay Agarwala and Chris Graveling from last week's XI, the visitors were forced to reshuffle their left flank and defence and were glad to welcome back Rob Hay from injury and Jim Thorpe from a burgeoning love affair with Canadian chicken wings.
After an early exchange of skirmishes, South quickly asserted their dominance, with Rob Barton and newly-minted left wing John Taylor both close to rounding the home keeper in the first two minutes after an attacking run by Matt Readman. Rick Erlebach's strike from a third minute short was well stopped but he soon had another chance when Rob Garrett was spectacularly upended by a clumsy challenge just inside the twenty-five. This time, Erlebach's switch was intercepted and March released their left-winger on a fast break with Readman in hot pursuit but it was keeper Steve Parker, calling early, who finally put a stop to matters by tackling decisively from the edge of the D. A similar run by Matt Murray was then rudely interrupted as his legs were taken from under him amidst a flood of apologies from the embarrassed perpetrator. However, South quickly won a third short, which was again stopped by the keeper after Thorpe, pushing out as to the manner born, gave Erlebach the perfect feed.
Thorpe was then immediately on hand at the rear to calmly turn a two-on-one into a none-on-one, whereupon Veejay Agarwala worked a move nicely across through Erlebach to right-wing Garrett, whose cross found a March foot for South's fourth short. Erlebach on this occasion slipped to Barton, who was denied from a shot of measured pace, but on thirteen minutes, after making two further blocks following another South short, the home keeper was helpless to prevent Taylor stepping up to cream a lifter over him and give South a deserved 1-0 lead.
Readman and Thorpe then each had to pull out the stops to repel concerted March attacks and, though still in charge, especially through Hay, Rob Sprawson and Garrett, South had to take care not to be rounded by the eager home attack, whose energy was personified by the strong running (and vociferous encouragement) of their fifty-one-years-young right winger. After an excellent cross to the spot from Murray, Taylor got himself two bites at the cherry but was pluckily denied by the keeper and March funnelled the ball up the right, Erlebach and Agarwala notwithstanding, to win their first short after twenty-five minutes. Good work by Hay relieved the pressure but March soon came close when a free hit into the circle just cleared the bar after a neatly-angled deflection.
Keeper Parker was then called on to make two saves and clear in double-quick time before Erlebach sent up a cunningly-placed aerial which so impressed March's veteran right-winger that he was moved to cry ""Watch two little ducks, no. 22!"" The centre-half, his shirt number now apparently reducing him to the status of a bingo token, responded by setting up another promising move with Garrett but, although this was eventually foiled, South continued to attack, with Barton shooting just wide after an incisive feed to the inside-right channel and the defence combining smoothly to collect and distribute. But the score remained 1-0 at half-time and South clearly needed more of a cushion to feel safe against opponents who are used to scoring three or four goals a game.
Emboldened by some state-of-the-nation remarks from Erlebach, South pressed strongly in the opening minutes of the second period. Hay won good ball at the back, Barton had a shot saved, Readman beat two men going forward with classic overtaking manoeuvres and then Garrett delivered a pinpoint cross from the goal-line. Sprawson's shot was saved but, when the rebound came free, Murray administered the prescribed treatment on the far post to put March two behind on thirty-nine minutes.
South had another chance two minutes later when Sprawson again sent away Garrett, whose cross to just inside top D had Taylor's eyes bulging as he raced in to strike. Sadly, the net failed to bulge in sympathy as the ball continued on a separate path and March broke loose to win a second short despite Agarwala's staunch delaying tactiSouth on the left. The resulting shot went wide after a bobble but March persisted and, though Sprawson tackled firmly and Readman anticlockwised inventively out of trouble, a third short came after forty-seven minutes. This time, the strike was on target but Parker saved convincingly and the ball was cleared up the right wing for South to win two shorts of their own. The home keeper did well to make a stick save and two follow-ups on the first but evaded the action on the second, when Barton missed by very little after a neat switch by Erlebach.
There was little respite for him as Taylor and Barton buzzed round the D but March, unfazed by the close attention paid to their defence, hit back in an entertainingly fluctuating passage of play which saw Parker tested to the limit but emerging with flying colours. A weighty block and tackle from the South keeper on fifty-one minutes preceded March's fourth short, when they had a clear chance to walk the ball in after a slip, but Parker formed an impassable barrier with stick, gloves and then pads before impressively breaking down another short with a trademark block and clearance. Thus repulsed, March were soon back on their heels when Taylor, ably assisted by Barton, Sprawson and Garrett, surged into the D, forcing a clearance, and Erlebach put Barton clean through on a one-on-one. Barton went left but the keeper read it and dispossessed him on the edge, and the action reverted swiftly to South's circle, where, following a low, flicked penalty corner, Parker made an outstanding block with his right glove close to the ground and then defied all March's attempts to hit it past, over, under or through him.
Further danger was averted by Thorpe's calm dismantling of a two-man break on fifty-eight minutes and, though March were always keen to get forward, more space began to open up for the South wingers and Erlebach was able to find Garrett and sub John Benedikz, positioning themselves astutely, at will. Garrett in particular was almost unstoppable up the right flank and both Murray and Sprawson weighed in to good effect. But, conscious of the fact that any lapse at the back could lead to an unnecessarily anxious last five minutes, South reined back from all-out attack, and rightly so, as Sprawson was forced to make a fine reverse tackle and Thorpe twice had to do his Horatio impersonation when March sought to storm the bridge. Together, though, he, Agarwala, Hay and the ever-resourceful Readman held March at bay and South earned a late bonus when Barton, profiting from a rebound, swept in a tumbling reverse-stick shot to put the issue beyond doubt and seal an important victory whose margin would certainly have been greater but for a committed and resolute performance from the home keeper.
Skipper Steve Parker was delighted with the victory, which put his team back on track after the irritation of the Long Sutton game. He was particularly keen to praise the spirit and commitment of the side in what was, once again, a key game against potentially tricky opponents.","Men's 1sts beat March Town 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Three goals in fairly quick succession in the first half gave Southouth a mountain to climb. The first two had an element of luck as Boston picked up a poor sixteen yard hit (goal 1) and then left keeper Poole stranded (goal 2) as the ball took a deflection off a defender's foot. The third goal was a simple matter of leaving the centre forward unmarked. Further goals were prevented by some last ditch defending with a couple of goal line clearances.
In spite of these setbacks, Southouth had regained their combative spirit since the previous week's drubbing. Pressure on the Boston goal led to a number of short corners, which all produced shots, one of which was converted confidently by Andy Lewis before the defence could get close. Creed and Korstanje continued to turn defence into attack throughout, but too often the final pass went begging.
The second half was much more even as CSHC sniffed the opportunity to come back. John Greaves in particular could have had a hatrick as his close range efforts were scrambled away off the line time after time. Unfortunately it was Boston who got the next goal with the defence outnumbered leaving the right winger an easy flick in. This was followed by a similar fifth goal, this time from the left-winger. It would have been six but for a magnificent save by Tim Poole from a well taken penalty.
The final minutes were dominated by South, who grabbed a second goal as Dan Adlington bundled the ball in through a crowd of players.

On a day that would have obliged Mr Beaufort to start thinking up some bigger numbers, South overcame both the gale-force conditions and their opponents to register a significant victory which for much of the game looked as though it might elude them. Teamwork and persistence were the key and this was reflected in the afternoon's most crucial intervention, when a mass effort succeeded in shifting the heavy wooden seating on the touchline to behind the northern goal, providing essential reinforcement and thus preventing a recurrence of the blowdown that had led to the abandonment of an earlier match.
Forced to play into the wind, South set their teeth grimly and, though largely unable to communicate going forward, they managed to dominate the early phases of play. John Taylor was direct and uncompromising from the off and Matt Murray soon put in a good feed to Sanjay Agarwala, who tricked his way round the goal-line only to find the keeper's pads at the near post. There were further presentable chances on offer for Taylor, Rob Sprawson and Agarwala again but no-one was able to take advantage as shots scurried wide or the defence cleared without fouling. A neat passing move instigated by Steve Fleck and moving up through Rob Hay and Chris Graveling - relishing the Russell Crowe part in the absence of Rick Erlebach - looked promising, but once more the final ball was off target. Indeed, before fifteen minutes were up, South could easily have been three or four goals to the good as a hatful of opportunities went begging; Taylor rounded the keeper with ease but just failed to convert, Sanjay Agarwala fell trying to strike in a Fleck pass and the keeper than smartly deflected a goalbound effort from the ubiquitous Taylor.
Meanwhile, Jim Thorpe - his ample shorts flapping around like a distressed marquee - had defied the elements to bulldoze forward more than once, whereas partner-in-crime Matt Readman preferred the knife-through-butter approach as he angled niftily upfield. Although Nomads had not looked especially dangerous, it was they who won the first short after fifteen minutes when a switched flick drew a fine diving save from skipper Steve Parker, who got a full stick on a shot destined for the net. A second short three minutes later was switched to the other side, leaving a gaping hole which Parker valiantly tried to fill, but this time he could only parry the flick as it found its way through various bodies and into the goal.
South continued to play positively, though, ragging it forward when more classical options were unavailable, yet despite all the pressure, they could not broach the magnetic field that seemed to have encircled the visitors' net. Fleck twice shot wide from decent positions, Rob Barton was unlucky to miss with a reverse and the same player, like Taylor earlier, sidestepped the keeper but found the final touch maddeningly elusive. Good approach play from Murray and Veejay Agarwala always threatened to set something up and Rob Hay and the rest of the defence were steady when it mattered but South, having weathered thirty-five minutes of energy-sapping resistance work, had become slightly disjointed when Nomads nearly went two up with a backhand scoop from the left of the circle which Parker teased past the post with pad and glove.
With the wind in their favour as the second half started, South quickly won their first short after Taylor's punishing shot had been saved and incisive moves by Fleck and Sprawson had set Nomads back on their heels. A clean strike from the edge of the D was half-smothered by the keeper and cleared off the line as Nomads survived again and, within ten minutes, further shots by Fleck and Sanjay Agarwala had also been snuffed out. Graveling, Agarwala and Barton all tried hard to break down the visitors' composed defence but there were always plenty of men behind the ball and there seemed no clear way through the thickets.
When Nomads made way into the headwind, Parker stopped an awkward shot aimed straight at his feet with a ""penguin special"" before booting to safety, and then intercepted a cross with a booming kick which almost decapitated Hay, who graciously forebore to concede a short by quickly pretending nothing had happened. A similar cross from Taylor at the other end was unmet and, with the game entering its final quarter, even the normally upbeat Murray - hoarse with emotion or it may have been laryngitis - had let his bedside manner slip by wondering whether a cancellation might not have been the better option.
But South held their nerve and, after a storming run by Taylor, won their third short of the afternoon, from which Sprawson scored the equaliser by driving in weightily off a defender's stick (it was always going in, of course - I know, because Rob told me so himself - Ed.). Readman then dispossessed Nomads' front-runner with a daringly kleptomaniac tackle and, spurred on by Thorpe's improving maxims from the rear, South burst forward in numbers. Murray's big shot from the right of the D was somehow blocked in front but Sanjay Agarwala dived into the resulting scrum and, by sheer force of personality, finally persuaded the ball to negotiate the last few inches over the line. Still reeling, Nomads then succumbed again when Murray one-handed his way round the right wing for Fleck and Sanjay Agarwala to wrong-foot the defence and release Barton on the left of the D. The latter reversed a cross from an acute angle to the far post, where Graveling stabbed in a want-it goal on the second attempt after the keeper had all but closed the gap.
Three strikes in five minutes had given South the breathing space they wanted and they then really started to develop more fluency. Despite a sixty-fifth minute short from Nomads, again a dangerous switch routine which saw Parker having to move quickly to cover a flick that whizzed into the side-netting, South had the upper hand in the final ten minutes, with assured passing from Rear-Admiral Graveling a feature, complemented by an excellent steal and scintillating now-you-see-it-now-you-don't run from Veejay Agarwala. Readman, too, had a characteristic diagonal thrust while Thorpe tended the sheep back home and, though Sprawson failed to double his tally at a sixty-seventh minute short, he rounded things off by putting in an exquisitely-timed reverse tackle as the whistle (manfully blown by Jim Sutcliffe in the face of almost overwhelming meteorological competition) blew to set the seal on a well-earned victory that had not been without its alarms.","Men's 1sts beat Cambridge Nomads 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

The first one was somewhat unlucky as the ball deflected wickedly off Andy Bleach's stick to elude keeper Poole.
Although the away side got gradually back into the game, with the reshaped defence marshalled by the always effective Tim Poole keeping Wisbech attacks at bay, the attack did not have enough penetration. Wisbech got a third goal from a short corner, from which they had to have four shots before finally breaching the defence.
South's main hope seemed to be from corners and so it proved, with the Greaves-Lewis short corner routine giving Andy Lewis his chance to bury a rasping shot beyond the keeper, to reduce the deficit to 3-1.
After half time the game continued to be open end to end stuff, but there were few real chances. Ali Blake and Andy Lewis tried manfully to launch attacks but the final decisive ball never materialised. Wisbech's efforts were mainly kept out by Poole's acrobatics, but South eventually managed a second goal from another short corner. This time Lewis, instead of shooting, evaded the advancing defenders to slip the ball back to Greaves, who controlled it calmly before whacking it into the net from longish range (i.e. longer than his usual two yards).
Sadly South were unable to get the equaliser, against one of the league's stongest teams, in spite of continued pressure.

Due to confused communication the game started nearly an hour late but this did not seem to bother South in the least. Calls from a nervous captain for a walkover to be awarded were rejected by the team who wanted to save themselves with style  and they did.
In a classic game of strike and counter-strike, short corners, heroic saves and fast flowing hockey, South emerged victorious and thus staved off what could have been a very unfair relegation.
South were fired up from the start of the gam. However despite having several good chances, it was March who scored first. In a goalmouth scramble, March tried to push the ball home but it was a South clearance that rebounded off the prone form of keeper Will Benedikz into the net for an agonising opener.
This goal knocked South a little and gave March confidence to push forward looking for a second. It was the heroic defending of Andrew Pounce, Ky Ho, Will Marston and sweeper John Benedikz, along with the dogged tackling back of the midfield that prevent March from having another real opportunity to score in the first half. As always South looked dangerous on the counter attack with midfielders David and James Bridge, Stuart Creed and Finn Johnson making fast breaks down the wings to Nick Wong and Wilco Dijkstra. South had a number of chances including three short-corners which were just pulled wide of the left-hand post.
Following an inspired half time team talk from captain Will Benedikz, South were roused into playing their best half of hockey all season. It was fast flowing, committed and determined without a pause in concentration or confidence.
South pushed forward from the off and, notwithstanding the risk of a rapid March counter attack always hanging over them, pinned down the visitors inside to their own twenty-five yard line and bombarded their goal with shots. Despite this pressure ironically the equalising goal came from a Cambridge counter attack. From defence the ball was spread wide to the right where Finn Johnson moved the ball on with a pinpoint pass down the line for Nick Wong to drive into the circle. In the melee of players that filled the circle it was Nick who reacted first to fire home from close range for the important point-securing goal.
The next twenty minutes were a battle for midfield supremacy. Having gained control of the middle of the pitch James Bridge and Stuart Creed continued to move the ball wide down the wings away from March's talented danger men. South had a clear flick turned down when the March umpire saw the ball played with the back of a stick instead of the kicked clearance  March's captain did apologise for this decision at the time.
With the score, and the game, balanced on a knife edge it was clear that another goal for the either side could secure the game. March, fired up by the thought of defeat, came back into the game and used their wingers to good effect. With several attacks down the South left, March crossed balls towards the penalty spot, only for keeper Will Benedikz to produce some excellent diving saves to clear the ball from the danger area. On the one occasion, when Will had missed the ball, Finn Johnson popped up amongst three forwards to spoil the shot and save a certain goal.
With sixty minutes on the clock and the pace of the game steadily increasing, South won what was their eighth short corner of the game. James Bridge pushed the ball rapidly out for John Benedikz, who with the aid of a powerful shot and a slight deflection up over the keeper's foot, scored in the middle of the goal as the team and partisan crowd erupted.
The last ten minutes were played at a furious rate as all the team defended as far up the pitch as possible then broke back in support at the first sign of danger. Once again the defence and midfield ran themselves into the ground to prevent an extremely talented March side from spoiling the day.

Reports of the celebrations following the news of Deeping's result are understandably hazy at present but Jim Thorpe distinctly remembers something about ordering an open-top bus
As for Saturday's match, South once again proved their sheer versatility by overcoming the handicap of a third consecutive away game in which the changing facilities were bedevilled by a mysterious, if not necessarily deliberate, absence of loo roll. Overcoming Wisbech proved more of an obstacle, however, although there was little indication of the problems in store in the opening passages of play, when Rick Erlebach laid on a beautifully-weighted ball for Rob Garrett to show off his startling turn of speed in the right corner. Garrett and Rob Hay then swapped textbook passes after Chris Graveling had carved out space for himself on the left and the pressure quickly told when Wisbech failed to disentangle themselves from a goalmouth melee which saw Garrett just beat off Rob Sprawson's challenge to knock the ball past a disorientated keeper. By the eight minute mark, South had doubled their lead thanks to Matt Murray, who swept in an unstoppable first-timer from Rob Barton's cross to make all that arduous visualisation practice worth it (although fifteen years is maybe a long time for the payback to arrive!).
Wisbech swiftly pulled themselves together, adopting closer man-marking tactics and squeezing Erlebach in the midfield - so to speak - to pressurise South's distribution hub. The policy paid instant dividends as they gained possession, pelted upfield and found an unmarked forward on the overlap who unleashed a quick shot in the D. Keeper Steve Parker, advancing decisively, blocked the drive with stick and gloves to save the day but, within a minute, South's lead was cut when a crisply-struck short from an angle evaded Parker's normally magnetic stick. Worse was to follow moments later when a defensive breakdown allowed Wisbech to pinball it around the D and then in at the far post for a twelfth minute equaliser.
The tight marking continued and, despite Matt Readman playing the Artful Dodger at the back, it was only Murray and Garrett who were really able to shake off their pursuers. Wisbech kept their foot on the throttle and South were lucky to escape further disaster when a lone forward pinged the ball against an upright. Yet, in a trice, Sprawson had sent Garrett away down the right and the latter, as so often leaving the defence hacking at thin air, Road-Runnered round the back to put in a perfect cross which Barton gleefully turned in with another excellent first-timer.
3-2 up after twenty minutes still represented a lot of hockey to go, though, and South soon had cause to be grateful for Veejay Agarwala's solid clearance and a good left-foot stop from Parker as Wisbech threatened to break through. Agarwala was in the thick of it again moments later, making an athletic dive to divert the ball away from a keen-jawed Wisbech attacker and then South turned the tables after Graveling had been flattened by what only a euphemist would have called a robust challenge. Two shorts in quick succession built the pressure and, though Barton could only find the feet of the (admittedly very large) goalkeeper with the first and nothing came of the second, South retained possession so that, when Sprawson powered a free hit into the D, Garrett was able to collect it a few feet from the near post and, unchecked, slide it under the keeper with a breathtaking piece of tic-tac wizardry.
With ten minutes still to go to the interval, Murray made sure Wisbech stayed under the thumb with some quickfire mental disintegration patter from the subs' bench and - as ever vicious but fair - added some telling advice for his own defence. The score stayed at 4-2 in South's favour, however, as Garrett posed further questions up front and Readman held off the aggressive Wisbech forwards with a fine recovery and tackle.
The second half started with Wisbech in the ascendancy, winning a short corner which, again cleanly struck after a well-rehearsed slip, was confidently blocked by Parker and cleared by Readman. A shot at the far end went wide and a period of grimly-contested midfield battles then ensued, with Thorpe and Agarwala working hard, Erlebach and Graveling getting stuck in with some ferociously determined tackling and Readman being called over by the umpire for a ""businesslike"" approach to a fifty-fifty ball. The official, underwhelmed by the player's opening gambit of ""What, me?"", was finally mollified when Matt turned on his innocent choir-boy's grin and promised not to argue, thus earning only a green and the chance to be even more businesslike later on.
With fifty minutes gone, South seemed just to be getting on top as John Taylor ran persistently hard on the left and Murray forced a save from the Wisbech keeper but defensive frailties re-emerged, with little support for Agarwala as he manfully tried to make headway out of the twenty-five. Soon, the ball had been funnelled along the South goal-line and sheer weight of numbers and persistence bundled the ball past a wall of bodies to bring the score back to 4-3 and open up the possibility of a distinctly tricky last twenty minutes. But, after Graveling had pulled off an absolutely crucial tackle at the edge of the South D, an attack built up and Taylor found himself suddenly free on the right. Advancing into the circle, he enticed the keeper to come out fractionally too early, picked his spot and slotted the ball home in controlled fashion to restore the two-goal margin. The force was with South at this point, and Murray lifted a flick just over the bar before reversing a pass from the left which Taylor, his appetite whetted, put away neatly to make it 6-3. If South had managed to convert either of the two subsequent shorts, the i's would have been dotted and the t's crossed, but Murray was just wide with a belligerent first-timer from an Erlebach switch and then Wisbech somehow managed to keep out a double-slip move which ended up with most of the defence facing the wrong way.
Refusing to lie down, the home side sprinted forward to win a short corner, the resulting direct hit - again from an unusual angle - well controlled by Parker's right pad. The next short, moments later, was slipped and Parker again made a technically excellent save with stick and gloves before finally ending Wisbech's chances on sixty-two minutes with a superb double block and long barrier which the home side simply could not break down.
Thereafter, though the Fenlanders never stopped trying, they were unable to get past the calm and cultured Agarwala, the obdurate Hay or, indeed, Sergeant-Major Thorpe in typical square-bashing mode (""This is getting scrappy, Cambridge South!""). As the clock ticked down, Graveling retained maximum possession with some intricate moves in midfield, Sprawson was spotted haring after the ball on the left wing, Garrett had time for a final chargeand South had done the business once more as their nearest challengers faltered at the final hurdle.

Tim Waller and Mark Jackson were both unlucky to shoot inches wide in open play and Rob Garrett was even more unfortunate to be hit on the head by a rising ball. It obviously missed any essential parts of his anatomy as he barely flinched.
Skipper John Greaves almost got in on the scoring act with a trademark close range effort that was blocked by a defender on the line after going past the keeper.
The second half was more even but more tetchy. John Greaves developed a convincing limp (5.9) which was applauded generously after losing arguments with opposition stick and ground. South's third goal was probably the best one with Rob Garrett and Tim Waller exchanging passes before Garrett slipped the ball to the waiting Rob Barton who buried the ball in the net with a reverse stick special.
Throughout the game the home defence and keeper stuck to the task and limited the skillful St Neots attack to few scoring chances. They managed a consolation goal from a short corner, but South held on for a well deserved victory.","Men's 2nds beat St Neots 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

The game could be compared to two de-clawed, toothless bears wrestling in a vat of crude oil  there was a lot of struggling in midfield as neither side got to grips with the other and there didn't seem to be much likelihood of either inflicting any real damage.
South turned up to the game with just nine players and borrowed the services of midfielder Hugh Bucknall. The game also saw the return of Andrew Leonard after a spell with the 2nds and Jack Chalk, back from university for Easter.
From the start of the game it was a midfield battle as both defences held firm. Nomads showed why they had finished third in Div 7NW by attacking quickly down the centre of the pitch. The rearranged South defence of Andrew Leonard, Ky Ho and Andy Pounce had little difficult in tidying up most of the surges forward and keeper Will Benedikz was left with few opportunities for action.
As the first half progressed South played a increasingly relaxed game which, when the passing was sharp, looked good and several reasonable scoring opportunities presented themselves to Jack Chalk, Wilco Dijkstra and Shan Golar. Alas South were thwarted by the Nomads keeper on all occasions.
After the break the game ebbed and flowed a little more with both sides having attacking opportunities. The South midfield of Hugh Bucknall, David Bridge, Shan Golar and Finn Johnson worked well as a unit and continued to move the ball round well. They also took advantage of the Nomads tendency to bunch around the ball and opened up the defence by spreading the ball wide. Finn, Jack and Wilco all had goal scoring chances from this simple manoeuvre.
Nomads won a couple of short corners during the second half but were unable to get a clean strike on all but one of these. Fortunately for South the one good strike was directed wide of the near post.
At the final whistle the game could be regarded as pleasant post-season wind down with South never looking troubled by the lower division team.
Honourable mention: Hugh Bucknall  We owe Hugh our thanks for swapping sides and helping out South. He played a committed game against his teammates and worked himself into good positions that could have resulted in a crucial goal.

Those coming from Peterborough were looking to continue their good days work after beating Peterborough (1-0) and those fresh from their game with Ely looking to rescue honour after the 1-9 defeat. There were even three or four players who hadn't doubled this week.
The opening phase of the game was a sloppy affair with little sight of the ball at either end and both teams struggling to put a string of passes together. South's striking partnership of Nick Wong and Jack Chalk struggled to get the ball into the opposition twenty-five, whilst the midfield combination of Wilco Dijkstra, Rob Barton, Shan Golar and Finn Johnson found themselves in a tussle for possession. All this hard work alas saw few proper attacking opportunities. The games first goal eventually arrived as Stevenage took a free hit on the edge of the South D very quickly. The shot was initially saved although the rebound was swept home past the prone keeper. This was a frustrating blow for South who were starting to play with more cohesion.
South's response was immediate and they turned up the pressure by driving Stevenage back into their own D and winning a series of short corners. Stevenage proved to be quick off the mark and South were unable to capitalise on any of their opportunities.
Stevenage made an unusual substitution, swapping their regular keeper for his first team equivalent, although this proved to be a critical mistake. The equaliser came from a short corner late in the half. A good push out from Chalk went straight to John Benedikz who, with his amazing ability of aiming the ball at the keeper every time did just that but, fortunately for South, Nick Wong appeared from nowhere just before the keeper got to the ball and diverted the ball into the corner of the goal.
Within minutes of the second half starting South drove into the Stevenage D and with the ball trapped under the keeper won a penalty flick. South's keeper/captain, Will Benedikz, came charging up-field up to take the stroke himself. Astoundingly as the stroke was being set up the umpires went into discussion and the decision was reversed to a sixteen yard hit.
The rest of the half became a game of steady build-up play from Stevenage punctuated by rapid South counter attacks, especially through Jack and Shan in midfield. The solid South defence of Andy Pounce, Rob Garrett, Rod Richardson and John Benedikz repelled every Stevenage attack and the equilibrium never looked like being broken by the home side. One final incident of note was a hard strike into the Stevenage D that was deflected inches over the bar by Nick Wong in a manner of which goal-machine Adlington would have been proud.
Big thank you to all those who have doubled up, especially to Rob Barton who didn't realise he was going to at the start of the day.

From the whistle it was clear that Cambridge were going to be tested in all areas of our game but the main problem was ball retention. Kettering were able to put together a dozen passes at will and work their way into scoring chances. We, on the other hand, were struggling to link up more than three or four passes and this proved to be the major differentiator between the sides.
Defensively, Cambridge looked slow and unintelligent. Marking was poor and we relied too heavily on interceptions to thwart an attack. There was some good tackling at times but too often the opposition were able to force a penalty corner. It was fortunate that Kettering were only able to convert a couple of these into goals during the game otherwise the damage would have been far greater.
The midfield never really had a chance to settle in the first half being swamped by a mobile opposition. Support was not there quick enough from the defence or the forwards and sometimes the simple passes were ignored in favour of a fruitless run or an over ambitious pass.
What breaks we did have up front usually were taken well but there wasn't enough service to the forwards. Good strong running was not followed up by a good final pass or a convincing attempt on goal. All in all, not the best start to the season for Cambridge South 1sts and there will have to be a radical improvement if we are to win points in the league as a newly promoted side.

South started the match slowly, but were unlucky to go behind when keeper Jim Sutcliffe's short corner clearance ricocheted back past him into the net. South didn't let this frustating goal get them down, and stepped up to dominate the rest of the half. Steve Riches's impressive marshalling of the defence allowed a solid base for the midfield to show their skills, culminating in Tim Waller netting a deserved equaliser to leave the half-time score 1-1.
The arrival of last season's top scorer, Nick Wong, back from the only game Arsenal haven't won so far this season (he knows how to pick 'em), prompted a half-time tactical change as South went looking for the win. However this move backfired as the loss of Steve Riches to umpiring duties saw the South defence weakened, and Blueharts took advantage of stray balls in the circle to twice force the ball home from close range.
South still had lots of the ball, and lots of play, but a pre-season tendency towards attempting to dribble through, instead of passing around, the opposition saw chances at a premium, and a winnable game eventually was lost.

The lessons of the pre-season friendlies had obviously been well learnt by the squad, as from the outset it was clear that the defence was better organised. Each player stuck well to his role and Chris Graveling was in complete control as sweeper. Throughout the first half Long Sutton never once threatened the goal and the large majority of the play was in their half. South pressed hard but a couple of opportunities at goal were squandered.
Rick Erlebach played with his usual composure in the middle of the midfield, but as the second half progressed Cambridge South sensed that three points were perhaps going to elude them and started to move further up the field. This let the Long Sutton attack take advantage with a couple of quick breaks, but only two shots on goal resulted and these were easily dealt with by the keeper. The increased pressure up the field for Cambridge however was creating several more scoring chances but all too often the final ball was lacking the killer touch.
When the whistle blew it was clear from the reactions of both teams that a nil-nil draw does not suit the home side at this stage of the season. However Cambridge South should be pleased with a steady start and a clean sheet and look to build on this next week.

Cambridge South started well and quickly gelled as a team. Unfortunately the home side scored first with an unstoppable effort from close range.
South had an immediate response with the best move of the match straight from the restart. Andy Lewis got the ball to the lightning fast Alex Pooles, who crossed for centre forward Nick Wong to bury the ball joyfully into the net for the equaliser. Alex Pooles continued to be a threat with a couple of other efforts going narrowly wide.
Sadly Long Sutton retook the lead as their forward picked up a loose ball to slip it into the net. Close to half time Long Sutton finally scored from one of their many short corners, although the goal came from a deflected effort. South had their share of short corners and were unlucky to suffer some marginal decisions preventing scoring efforts. Andy Lewis, again putting in herculean work all around the pitch, put a shot just wide from another well worked short corner.
Long Sutton dominated the period after the interval but the South defence held firm, with Mark Freer and Ky Ho solid and Steve lane and Sam Carr tenacious throughout. Defence was turned into attack with an increasing number of breakaways, often engineered by man of the match Chris Clegg, the linchpin in midfield.
The away team got back into the game from a good move up the centre of the pitch, from which skipper John Greaves took the ball around the side of the D and put in a deft reverse stick cross for the ever-sharp Alex Pooles to slot home. Soon after that South got a deserved equaliser after another flowing attacking move ended up with Greaves pouncing on a loose ball in the D to trickle the ball past the remaining defence for one of his usual jammy goals.
Sadly Long Sutton were able to come back once more and score the winner with a neat deflection form a quickly taken free hit.

The game was evenly matched for the most part but ultimately St Ives found the net more easily than the visitors.
At the back Cambridge looked reasonably secure and it was an unfortunate deflection from a South stick that steered the ball into the goal for St Ives first from an otherwise innocuous short corner. That incident aside, the defence looked pretty secure for the first half with Andy Rose having to use all his considerable experience to keep on top of the Saints' lightning right winger. The game also heralded a welcome return by Rob Hay in the right back position.
The midfield worked well and new signing Richard Morgan fitted in well on his debut. It was the midfield that claimed Cambridge South's equaliser 10 minutes before half time when Rick Erlebach struck South's only short corner hard towards the side board and the keeper could only deflect it into the top of the net.
At 1-1 at half time, South were looking to push hard and take all three points from the game. The second half started well with Matt Murray and Rob Garrett working well together down the right. However the break never came and the keeper proved too quick on a number of occasions when we caught sight of goal.
Eventually, one of the numerous St Ives breaks resulted in a hit outside the D which the home side took advantage of. The wily old centre forward, playing a classic ten minutes on, ten minutes off resting strategy, slipped his marker, Thorpe, and the far post and pounced on a loose ball to slip it over the keeper.
South pushed back hard and created several more chances but eventually the commitment up the field let in the Saints' nippy young left wing to score an impressive solo goal. 3-1 on the day, again not what was required but Cambridge South will look forward to hosting St Ives 2nd team for the return leg in January.","Men's 1sts lose to St Ives 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Cambridge South started brightly and saw plenty of possession in the first half. Chris Baker and newcomer Ryan Thomas looked in control of the midfield going forwards and both John Taylor and Matt Murray up front were creating space well for themselves. The first blow soon came however as Peterborough stole an early goal, exposing some lack of defensive focus. The second followed not long after when a penalty corner resulted in the shot sneaking underneath the keeper.
South showed good spirit and fought back hard. The first short of the game for the home side saw a good strike from Baker blocked and Matt Murray pounced on the deflection to bury one for Cambridge. Shortly after Murray struck again as a loose ball in the D was snaffled up by the predatory left winger.
2-2 at half time and the game was still on. A re-organisation for the second half was unfortunately less than successful, and large gaps opened in the defence. Alex Pooles made his debut at attacking centre half and showed some bright running, and Ryan Thomas dropped to sweeper to cover for the resting Raphael Mis.
Peterborough struck soon in the second half as an unchecked player, allowed too much time by a retreating South, rounded the keeper and passed neatly across to an incoming right wing for a tap in. Shortly afterwards a unstoppable penalty corner for Peterborough was fiercely struck into the top right corner of the boards. 4-2 Peterborough, and there it ended as Cambridge South never really looked like getting in the game again.
Special mention needs to be made of the outstanding player of the match for the home team, Chris Baker. Hard work through out and sensible decisions helped orchestrate much of South's creative play. Chris will be a valuable player this year and crucially one capable of taking over from Rick Erlebach at centre half.

Early exchanges were fairly even as South looked to Raph Mis for inspiration upfront and he was unlucky not to win a couple of short corners. After ten minutes Town went ahead. The goal was scored from a penalty flick struck low to the goalkeepers left after determined South defence ended with the ball hitting a defender's foot on the goal line. Following the goal, Peterborough Town stepped up the pressure but were unable to convert it into decent chances and at half time the score was still 1-0.
South made pre-planned changes at half and pushed Jim Thorpe up into midfield and Richard Morgan stepped across into the centre of defence, where he put in a strong performance to show that he can make the position his own. A sweet attacking move from the restart saw South apply some early pressure by winning their first short corner of the match. However, nothing came of the short corner and the early second half promise was snubbed out by Town as South were forced to defend more and more deeply.
South had to put in a very determined defensive performance in the second half to prevent the Town pressure from telling and Chris Graveling put in a great performance as Sweeper, marshalling the defence and making numerous critical tackles. Despite South's gritty defence, Town got a well worked second goal from one of many short corners that their pressure produced in the last quarter.
South remain positive after the defeat and look forward to the new-look team gelling and fulfilling their undoubted potential. The defence looked far more settled this match and with no goals conceded from open-play, a platform has been laid from which they can improve their attacking play.

Bartram had an unfortunate penalty awarded against him, but he was able to save it confidently. Unfortunately, Peterborough got what proved to be the winner soon after, and continued efforts of a tiring South side to snatch a draw were in vain as the final pass into the D proved elusive.","Men's 2nds lose to Peterborough Town 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Things did not seem to go overly well when South found themselves 4-0 down inside the first twelve minutes. It was at this point that South showed a little of what they will be capable of. The midfield of David Bridge, Rupert Webb, Tim Gass and ably led by James Bridge pushed Horncastle back, testing their defence. James Bridge won what was to be South's only short corner after a long dribbling run into the D that beat several defenders before rolling the ball against a Horncastle foot. Sweeper John Benedikz powerfully dispatched the ensuing short corner through the keeper's legs. Two more unfortunate goals occurred before half time, leaving South 6-1 down at the break.
South's defence of Andrew Pounce, Sam Lansdell and John Benedikz, led by captain-elect Rod Richardson and aided by keeper Lino Di Lorenzo's good shot stopping abilities, turned the Horncastle tide back on many occasions, allowing the South strikers Phil Le Gouais and Jason Wong to pressure the Horncastle defence. South's best chance came when another dribbling run from James Bridge was fired just wide of the goal.
Despite a heavy margin of defeat South showed some signs of flair and they will get them much better results once the team settles down.","Men's 3rds pasted by Horncastle 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0
294,"23/10/2004","League",1,124,"TBC",0,"Home","1","4","","","False","False","False","A Jekyll-and-Hyde performance from Cambridge South at the Perse on Saturday saw them dominate the first half against a confident St Neots side but then concede four goals in twenty minutes directly after the break to register a fourth consecutive defeat.
The most encouraging feature of the first thirty-five minutes was the greater amount of ball seen by the forwards, with John Taylor in particular relishing his reacquaintance with the strange orange orb which had proved so elusive in the Peterborough Town game. In fact, the whole of the forward line was more involved and both Ryan Thomas and the returning Matt Murray also benefited from more coherent work up the flanks and through the centre.
St. Neots found South's forechecking difficult to counter and were unable to control the midfield as they would have wished. Andy Rose hassled tenaciously, Vijay Agarwala conjured up one of his deceptive fakir-like runs up the inside-left channel and Rob Hay contributed sensibly from right-back. Within the first quarter, Thomas had loosed off a quick shot and Doug Leckie had gone just wide after excellent approach work by Rose, whilst the all-action Taylor regularly posed a threat.
Taylor it was who drew a good diving save from the visitors' goalie from a clean penalty corner strike on twenty minutes and it would have been no surprise if South had scored at this juncture as both Murray and Thomas were sniffing blood. St Neots were clearly frustrated and, in addition to one of their number being green-carded in the first five minutes, the grumpy player with the Snow White shirt was given a stern talking-to by the umpire as Dopey watched bashfully on.
A thirtieth minute short corner gave St Neots hope but Rob Garrett, swiftly out, capped an excellent first half in an unaccustomed role as left-back by blocking the shot out for a long corner. The action ended with skipper Jim Thorpe clearing calmly from defence and South marginally on top despite a failure to convert.
But the second stanza might have been a different game as South were immediately put under pressure by a rejuvenated Saints. Keeper Steve Parker soon had to save a hard shot on his left post and, moments later, he was able to block an awkwardly bouncing strike from a St Neots short. A clearance failed to materialise, however, and St Neots tucked the ball away to take the lead. Worse was to follow on forty minutes as the visitors were awarded a stroke when an attacker broke free near the top of the circle and fell as Parker dived to drive him wide. It was far from clear whether any contact was made but St Neots took advantage of the situation to put home expertly in the top right-hand angle.
South hit back with two shorts after clever work by Thomas - who proved a reliable injector in the absence through illness of the influential Chris Graveling - but one was deflected off the line and the other charged down, a fate which also befell a mirror-image penalty corner in South's D. This time, though, the ball ballooned dangerously towards goal and Parker had to be both alert and accurate to divert it from under the crossbar and out of the path of the onrushing forward.
In an exciting passage of play, Thomas was unlucky to strike the St Neots bar with a fierce reverse shot, whilst Hay and Richard Morgan had their work cut out to stem the tide as the St Neots attack, seemingly a man stronger after the interval, flooded downfield. After a further incursion on the left, the visitors made it three in fifteen minutes with a fiercely-struck short into the bottom corner and, five minutes later, the gap became unbridgeable when St Neots again cut a swathe through the defence and left the diving Parker little chance with a neat chip in to make it 4-0.
Despite the scoreline, South still had their opportunities, particularly when winning two short corners in the forty-eighth minute, but first Murray and then Rose were unable to capitalise as the St Neots defence proved equal to the task. When Thorpe set Thomas up beautifully for the latter to snake an incisive pass into the D, South had another good chance but the finish was again missing. The shape and cohesion which had marked the home team's performance in the first half had by now been slightly eroded, although the forwards continued to press, with Rose's shot from South's fifth short well blocked and Thomas shooting wide.
But just when it looked as though St Neots would keep a clean sheet, the keeper misjudged a kick from a difficult bobbler, Murray replied with an (obviously deliberate) bobbling pass of his own and the predatory Taylor was on hand to ram the ball away for a late consolation. The hunger was still clearly there for St Neots, though - as a yellow card to their defender for a ""robust"" challenge on Thomas amply demonstrated - and they were able to prevent further inroads to take all three points. A disappointing result for South in view of their encouraging first-half performance.","Men's 1sts lose to St Neots 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

St Neots had most of the play throughout, and the Cambridge South defence battled manfully to keep out many short corners and other attacks, marshalled ably by Keith Simpson, John Benedikz and star keeper Jim Sutcliffe. Jim S made some spectacular saves to keep the score 0 - 0 at half time.
Early in the second half St Neots broke through with a shot off yet another short corner. South did have attacks, and forced some shorts, but were unable to get the decisive shots in. The away team did have a ""goal"" disallowed, a John Greaves two inch special, due to some rather forceful battering of the opposition keeper in search of the ball, which was hiding somewhere close to the keeper's pads. Soon after, St Neots went two up with a breakaway, outnumbering the tiring South defence.
South grabbed a consolation goal right at the end as the deserving Tim Waller, who had played well all game, prompting attacks and never giving up, pounced on a Rafael Mis free hit to put the ball past the keeper.
In summary, South, although committed and keeping positive for the seventy minutes, gave the ball away too often, and were unable to control the game or exert enough pressure to threaten a superior St Neots team.","Men's 2nds lose to St Neots 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Although South won five short corners in a ten minute period late in the game, they were unable to close the gap and were left ruing an unsettled start which saw them three goals down in the first quarter.
Indeed, Ely scored from their first penalty corner, just three minutes in, when a well-timed switch somehow ended up in South's net off a defensive stick. A second goal beckoned moments later as an Ely attacker raced unchallenged into the circle but keeper Steve Parker, with fine judgment, was swiftly out with an excellent stick tackle which blocked the shot and bought time for a clearance.
The home side kept their foot on the accelerator, though, and with their second short produced a low drag-flick which both Chris Graveling and Parker managed to get some wood on, but the ball ballooned up and was eagerly seized on by the second wave to make it 2-0. A third short was well stopped and cleared by Parker despite the closest of attention from the Ely forwards, whilst a fourth immediately after was charged down by left-back and authentic Road Runner impersonator Rob Garrett. But South were unable to clear their lines effectively and a textbook three-man move from Ely ended with an unmarked man on the spot whipping the third goal in past a slightly disorientated defence.
In these desperate circumstances, South at last began to recover some composure and organise themselves, with Rob Hay initiating a good, simple move up the wing through Andy Rose to John Taylor, and the hard-working Chris Baker, taking Graveling's feed, again releasing Taylor, who was fouled to give South their first short after fourteen minutes. This went unconverted and Ely continued to press strongly down the centre of midfield.
Garrett, Jim Thorpe and the cultured Vijay Agarwala manoeuvred their way convincingly out of trouble, however, and a more coherent approach to the build-up soon led to some dissension in the Ely ranks. Yet a string of two or three good passes too often tended to fizzle out or lack the final element of flair for a real breakthrough and Ely held on to their lead, which they would have extended in the twenty-third minute but for keeper Parker, who stonewalled a free shot from his left.
Garrett, meanwhile, continued to display a cool nerve in dribbling confidently out of defence, whilst at the other end Mark Freer put in a good cross which forced the Ely keeper into his first real action of the half. Freer was again behind a promising move which saw the determined Ryan Thomas apparently fouled by the keeper, but the half ended with South having to soak up more pressure at short corners as Ely sought to hammer home their advantage. After thirty-three minutes the ball was forced across a crowded D and a snap shot from one of the home forwards rattled in through a forest of bodies past an unsighted Parker.
After a brief whiff of smelling salts at the interval, South looked more joined up and Agarwala, shielding the ball well, worked nicely with the tireless Baker, who played intelligently throughout to find free space and call his availability. Baker it was who took a good pass from Freer and challenged the Ely keeper, only for the ball to be scrambled away at the death. Baker and Thorpe were instrumental in several further promising forays, with the normally earthy Thorpe putting up a finely-tuned aerial down the right and then working a classic give-and-go with Richard Morgan before the threat was snuffed out.
On forty-five minutes, an unpleasant-looking gap in midfield was quickly filled by a pair of Ely attackers and a simple pass gave one of them a big chance unmarked in top D, but Parker judged the shot nicely and angled it astutely out of danger with a good kick to his right. Hay then cut out a dangerous break before Garrett, who was virtually impassable at left-back in a fine exhibition of shadowing and deft tackling, streaked up the left and almost found an opening. Agarwala repeated the dose with a run of mazy brilliance and was only just denied at the last by the keeper, and then Thomas went wide after good approach work by Rose and Baker, backed by sterling defence from Graveling.
South survived a further Ely surge as an awkward deflection was tipped over the bar but then struck back with five short corners in a sustained spell of pressure triggered by Thomas and Rose. On the first, Baker's flick from a Thorpe switch was saved, whilst the second saw the keeper also stop a firm direct hit from Thorpe. In the meantime, Taylor sprinted gazelle-like (?? - alternatives on a postcard, please!) onto a clever held-up pass from Thomas before taking an unscheduled flight thanks to a firm diving tackle by the keeper. A third short on sixty-three minutes nearly brought results when a double slip by Thorpe freed Agarwala to shoot, but the flick was well diverted past the post. Thorpe was again in the thick of it when crossing to Taylor, who slid the ball wide to the right after the goalie had spreadeagled himself.
Baker then held close control in a confined space to help Agarwala set up Thomas, who won a final short with his favourite tricky manoeuvre. Thorpe switched right this time but Baker could not quite swivel his hips for the shot in timely enough fashion and, though South had the ball in the net twice in the last five minutes (both times unfortunately from outside the D), it was a case of too little, too late and too loose as the team were left to reflect on what might have been but for those first fifteen minutes.","Men's 1sts lose (again) to Ely City 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Cambridge South had the first injury, with skipper John Greaves suffering a fractured thumb from a well-struck Alford defensive hit out.
South also had the first goal, following a fine move involving an interchange of passes between Marston, Lewis, and Murray who buried the ball confidently from close range.
Then it was Alford's turn, with Murray's stick deftly extracting a defender's tooth from its socket. Both tooth and defender took no further part in proceedings.
Half time 1-0, with South holding on well. Brave defence led by sweeper Simpson alternating with breakout attacks from all angles. Andy Lewis, and Stuart Creed particularly prompting many of South's best moments.
Constant pressure from Alford, with a number of short corners all repelled, eventually gave them the equaliser, having had other attempts foiled by the woodwork, and excellent keeping from Jon Bartram. Nevertheless South continued to press, showing no signs of their early season unfitness. Will Marston particularly found space through intelligent running, and Murray scampered around the pitch to great effect.

Continuity of personnel has proved something of problem thus far and Saturday's game was no exception as the absence of Rob Garrett, Andy Rose and Veejay Agarwala led to three enforced changes from the squad who played against Ely.
The balance of the early play belonged to Nomads, who had three strong attacks in the first five minutes. Their first short, after three minutes, was successfully steered away by the diving Steve Parker, who then aggressively dispossessed the Nomads' right-winger after chasing him along the goal-line. Chris Graveling put in several uncompromising challenges, aided by Richard Morgan, but a neat move from the visitors' right opened up a yawning gap which was deftly exploited by a Nomads forward, who bore down into the D and put away an immaculately-timed chip over the exposed Parker. The South keeper then crucially blocked a free shot from a double-shimmied short before sprinting out to the right corner and nervelessly clearing from an unmarked winger with a diving stick tackle.
Debutant Franois Lemoine showed his mettle by racing out to stop the shot from Nomads' third short on 10 minutes but, after skipper Jim Thorpe and Ryan Thomas had won some good ball in midfield, another defensive breakdown let the Nomads' right-winger into the D unchecked. Spotting the danger early, Parker ate up the ground to dive and make the block, but a second unaccompanied Nomads forward was on hand to sweep the ricochet into the net off a defensive stick. Nomads had a fourth short on seventeen minutes, but Morgan, with a neat tackle, and Graveling, with a first-time clearance, saw off the threat. Parker had to clear again moment later as Nomads again rounded the back line and the recovery was completed when Matt Murray sensibly reverse-sticked it to safety down the left wing.
John Taylor then barged his way down the opposite wing, drawing an obstruction, and South soon won a long and then their first short. Thorpe hit cleanly, forcing the keeper to save, a mite woodenly perhaps, and this chance seemed to inspire South to a better-organised passage of play. Murray, Chris Baker and Rob Hay interpassed nicely, Lemoine showed a good turn of pace out of defence and Graveling was, as usual, solidity personified. Murray hit the side-boards after a long, Baker put through Taylor, who was denied by the keeper, and when Nomads attacked again, Doug Leckie dribbled out of the home D with a measure of sang-froid.
But, on the stroke of half-time, Nomads' number eighteen broke through three tackles to force the visitors' fifth short, which was switched to the right before being hit back across the D. A Nomads winger poised on the far post was already turning in celebration as he redirected the ball goalwards but Parker, flying to his right, gloved it away to keep South in the game.
South profited from this escape and, after the break, they imposed themselves increasingly, with Baker in particular working overtime to create useful openings. On thirty-nine minutes, it was Baker who bundled through into the right of the circle and delivered the perfect feed to Thomas, who scored arguably the goal of the season so far with a quickly-struck reverse shot high over the goalie's right shoulder. South upped the pace despite their opponents' willingness to move forward and, over the next ten minutes, won a succession of penalty corners, but neither the slip nor the direct hit brought dividends as shots from Thorpe, Taylor and Leckie all found the keeper's pads.
Promisingly, the South forwards began to close down defensive hits out - not always a feature of previous games - and, at this stage, Nomads looked distinctly second best although Parker was forced to save on the ground after a rare break-out. Baker worked hard to win South's fifth short after 53 minutes, which was kicked clear after Leckie's shot, and led the battle for midfield domination as the game became a little scrappier. A long ball in from Thorpe led to another short four minutes later and, this time, it was the skipper himself who jubilantly rifled home a well-angled drive for the equaliser.
The play then seesawed agonisingly as Nomads hit wide from a good chance in the right of the D and Thomas narrowly missed after a pretty four-man move involving Murray, Thorpe and Baker. Lemoine, who improved encouragingly as the game went on, remained calm under pressure, tackling and hitting strongly at left-back and, when Murray was heavily decked to gain a free hit in the sixty-third minute, South were on the offensive just outside their opponents' twenty-five. But, despite further good work from Leckie and Baker, the tide turned when Nomads' left-winger put in a long run down the side and was left unchallenged along the goal-line to deliver a simple pass which was gleefully tapped in for what proved to be the winning goal four minutes from time. Despite all South's efforts, exemplified by the inexhaustible Baker, Nomads retained control and defended desperately to see out the game, leaving a crestfallen home side to wonder what they must do to start climbing the table.","Men's 1sts lose (again) to Cambridge Nomads 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

After weathering some early Ely pressure the signs looked even more promising, when South's first coherent attack drew a short-corner. From this, a good clean routine between John Benedikz and Raph Mis drew a solid block from the Ely keeper. Alex Pooles reacted sharpest to the loose ball and his finish was calmness personified, lifting the ball into the far corner.
After this promising start, however, South were unable to keep things going, and quickly conceded an equaliser. Slack midfield passing saw the defence caught out of position, and Ely worked a nice move to give their dangerous centre-forward the space to sweep home.
Following this, the game took and end-to-end characteristic, with Alex Pooles and Raph Mis tormenting the home defence, and the Ely centre forward's alertness causing problems for the visitors. Towards the end of the half, South broke through again, when Stu Creed's driven free hit from the right wing brought another block from the Ely keeper, only for the ball to drop onto Andy Lewis's stick, and he smashed home from close range.
The second half would eventually prove to be the tale of two penalty flicks.
But it started in less dramatic fashion, though still highly positive for South, as they went looking for a killer third goal. The closest things being one sweeping move down the left involving Mis, Lewis and Johnson, which eventually saw the Ely keeper half-block Mis's shot, and the defence smuggle the ball away. Another, from a short corner routine, saw Lewis get space for a shot, only for the keeper again to block.
Unfortunately South then shot themselves in the foot. A ball into the South D was not properly cleared, due to Souths propensity to try and dribble out of trouble. The ball was stolen, worked past keeper Steve Starkie and was goalbound until it struck Andy Bleach's foot for a clear penalty flick. Ely's young flick taker sent Starkie the wrong way to bring the scores level.
With the game now back into an end-to-end phase, South went looking for the winner they felt they deserved. And with five minutes remaining more good play down the left saw another short corner won. From this, Mis's goalbound shot hit a defenders foot on the line, for another clear flick. This time it was South turn to watch in hope, but unfortunately, though Mis connected well enough, the direction was slightly out, and the ball flashed wide. Not what Raph deserved, after a fine match playmaking for the South team.
Following a late scare, when more fraility in clearing the ball early from their own D lead to a number of short corners, from which fortunately Ely failed to capitalise, South were forced to settle for a draw, in a match they could, and maybe should, have won.
On the plus side, everyone had a good game, notably the central midfield axis of Stuart Creed and Raphael Mis, who formed a partnership that bodes well for the future. Raph's intelligent prompting as playmaker just edging out the more hard-running style employed by Stu for the man-of-the-match award.
Also deserving a mention were the front two of Alex Pooles (another classy game) and Finn Johnson (made all the right runs, that goal will come soon).","Men's 2nds draw against Ely City 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

There were real hopes that South, who played with confidence and discipline in the first thirty-five minutes, could finally string two good halves together and register their first victory but these were dashed six minutes from time when St Ives pounced on a loose ball in the D and gratefully buried the winner to claim the spoils.
The return of Rob Garrett at left-back and Andy Rose at left half gave skipper Jim Thorpe more options for both defence and attack and South set off positively, with Garrett - fresh from a stunning photo-shoot in last week's Cambridge Evening News - able to make several forays from a deep position. Rob Hay, who combined well with Chris Baker and the inventive Doug Leckie on the right, also set in train a sequence of solid moves up the flank and, after Steve Parker in goal had sticked away a crisply-hit short in the fourth minute, South built up the pressure inside the St Ives twenty-five. Hits were effectively ringed, forcing the defence into suspect passes, and both Rose and Ryan Thomas were close to latching onto through balls from the well-supplied midfield.
South's first short arrived after a raised hit in the eleventh minutes but Leckie's shot found a defender and was safely cleared. Leckie and Baker, benefiting from Chris Graveling's exemplary tackling and Hay's astute distribution, showed plenty of ground could be gained without risk by working a series of copybook triangles, but John Taylor and the hard-working Thomas - earlier dragged untimely from his bed in a complicated saga involving college porters, clocks going back and a missing hangover - just failed to apply the finishing touch.
Taylor, employing a nifty reverse-stick tackle in defence, and Garrett's easy pace nullified any threat at the rear and South continued in the ascendancy, winning a second short on twenty minutes. Thorpe controlled the push-out himself and struck convincingly home but the score remained 0-0 as the umpire decreed the ball had not left the circle. Eschewing an appeal to the European Court of Justice, the captain took the law into his own hands five minutes later when, from another penalty corner, he produced an unstoppable self-styled ""Thorpedo"" which skimmed the keeper's stacked pads and rattled the backboards with a vengeance.
Garrett had the opportunity to double the lead on twenty-six minutes but, perhaps confused by the plethora of goalposts from different sports, just slid the ball wide of the set that really mattered. St Ives were reduced to ten men for a period and, though Baker, Leckie and Thomas had caused havoc up the right wing, the home side broke out dangerously and got a man free down the left despite Graveling's close attentions. Thankfully, Parker was in the perfect position to make a fine diving block, which he followed up by defusing a shifty wobbling bouncer and then extending his legs almost telescopically to pile the pads high and deny a lone forward to the left of the D. Garrett filched the clearance away to Rose and Matt Murray herded up the right but, after South's fourth penalty corner came to naught, St Ives renewed the pressure. Parker cleared elegantly and decisively to the wing but moments later had a narrow escape as a fierce shot pinged off his right-hand post. South ended the half on top, though, with Leckie particularly on song and the team reaping the advantage of greater concentration and more controlled possession.
After the break, St Ives returned to full strength and, with captain Thorpe forced into the role of touchline general owing to a popliteal strain (and not, as widely rumoured, gout and incipient old age), South seemed to lose a little cohesion. There was repeated congestion in the visitors' D and both Baker and Richard Morgan had to get stuck in with no-mess, no-fuss clearances. A second home short on forty-two minutes was duffed, with Garrett and Leckie relieving the pressure, but a third on forty-four minutes boded ill for South when a deft slip to the left opened up the defence big-time. But Parker narrowed the angle on the rush and spread himself, making a superb pad save to deny St Ives the equaliser.
Things quickly swung back South's way as Leckie sent up a precise aerial, Thomas ran hard to sniff any advantages and Garrett and Franois Lemoine shuttled the ball swiftly up the left, drawing in Rose, Baker and Murray. A fifth South short after forty-eight minutes saw Baker's shot temporarily camouflaged by the keeper before Thomas's attempt at a work-around failed. By this stage, though, St Ives had begun to create ominous gaps in midfield and, despite a number of eagle-eyed interceptions by Graveling, a thoughtful reverse pass slipped through and St Ives won their fourth short. Switching left, they then dribbled right and inexorably worked their way into a position from where a well-placed forward made it 1-1 with a hard flick into the roof of the net.
More free space for St Ives ensued, and Parker did well to thwart a nasty spinning deflection and protect his goal as Garrett raced across to cover. Then Lemoine, as throughout causing problems with clever one-time passes, won a corner for South on fifty-six minutes but, missing Thorpe - still an anxious onlooker - the attempt fizzled out. Garrett's speed, which allowed him to recover for second-bite tackles even when seemingly passed, bought some time as South regrouped, with Lemoine pressing hard on the left and Taylor aggressive as ever on the right.
But St Ives continued to look menacing and, after Parker had kicked to safety from an awkward deflection and Baker's run from Rose's feed had been stopped dead in its tracks, the home forwards again manoeuvred themselves into a prime spot a few yards out. A rasping flick from the left was brilliantly sticked away by Parker to maintain the status quo but, with six minutes to go, a harmless-looking ball into the D somehow escaped South's defensive sticks and a home attacker was presented with the easiest of chances to ram in the go-ahead goal past the helpless Parker.
In a frantic final period of play, an X-rated melee in the St Ives circle - in which it appeared that the home goalie might well be bundled over the line in lieu of the ball - ended all square without a show of cards or police charges being pressed, while Baker's shot from South's seventh penalty corner was half-blocked before agonisingly looping inches wide of the post. So, despite much cajoling, the deus resolutely refused to climb out of the machina and St Ives just managed to hang on.
South, though disappointed at the last again, knew they could have won this game and can take heart from the fact that some promising units are developing within the team. However, there are going to be no easy victories in the higher division and the side will repeatedly need to maintain its collective focus and show total commitment for the full seventy minutes to start earning some reward.","Usual story; Men's 1sts lose to St Ives 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Alex Pooles poached a second from an unsuspecting defender to slam the ball into the net joyously.
St Ives, mainly using their playmaker in central defence who was used to higher league hockey, came back into the game after half time with a quickly taken free hit near the home D as the defence was still moving in to position. South didn't allow this to deflect them from their expansive attacking game, and were able to get a deserved third goal as midfield rock Raphael Mis played an incisive pass to that man Lewis, who deftly interchanged passes with the near post to slot in his second from close in.

Early exchanges were fairly equal between the teams, though Lino Di Lorenzo was rarely threatened in goal thanks to a solid defence from Ian Evans, Phil Le Gouais and Steve Morrell. As the first half progressed South managed to string together some more probing attacks. David Bridge (our erstwhile captain in the absence of Rodney and Andy Pounce) was linking up well with Wilco Dijkstra down the left hand side, while Chris Clegg and Andy Kennedy were providing good ball to Sam Carr through the centre who used his pace well playing for the first time at centre forward.
The real break through, however, came when a St Ives player had to leave the field due to a close encounter with a hockey ball and a forehead (everyone on the pitch felt the pain on impact!) A brief period with an extra man led to South putting a lot of pressure on the St Ives goal. The goal itself came from a free hit just outside the area. Wilco's carefully timed sweeping hit placed the ball comfortably in the back of the goal. Shortly after it was very nearly two.
Tim Gass took the ball to line and managed to flick it back to Sam Carr's stick. Sam only failed to find the back of the net due to a jumbled mess with a defender and the St Ives keeper. The chaos led to South being awarded a penalty flick and Will Marston bravely stepped up to do the honours. There was nothing much wrong with the flick, but unfortunately the keeper managed to get himself in the way of the ball and the goal.
Undeterred, South continued to attack well and we were aided in our quest by the fresh legs of George Bucknall coming on at centre forward.
The second half saw both sides putting together some good passing manoeuvres and South's defence were put under more pressure, enduring several short corners. Lino had to come well out of his area to make a good save fairly early on. On our side Will Marston and Chris Clegg were beginning to show some classy stick skills which led to pressure at the opposite end. One of the defences had to give out eventually and unfortunately it was South's - a scrappy goal that went in off the heel of Lino (not that he could do much about it!).
With the scores at one piece the match opened up even more - Tim Gass and Sam Carr were linking up on the right hand side, but so were St Ives. South fans must have had their eyes closed as a last minute short corner was awarded to St Ives. The St Ives striker was allowed three attempts at striking the ball, but fortunately he hit air on the first two occasions and then sent the third attempt wide.
There was barely time to draw breath before South were awarded a short corner at the other end. The whistle signalled the end of the match so we knew it was now or never. All of the team, save the keeper, lined up around the area and a fairy tale ending nearly ensued as Chris Clegg sent a shot past the goal keeper. Unfortunately it was cleared off the line by a defender's reverse stick onto a Cambridge foot. Overall it was South who had the best chances, but for a few agonising seconds it could have been St Ives that won.","Men's 3rds draw with St Ives 5","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0
306,"20/11/2004","League",1,53,"TBC",0,"Home","2","4","2","2","False","False","False","In an action-packed encounter against high-flying Horncastle, who have lost only one game so far and who drew with league leaders Bourne last week, South put up a wholehearted performance despite finishing up on the wrong end of a 4-2 scoreline. The visitors looked good for their victory on the balance of the game overall, but with a little more luck South could have snatched a welcome point at the death - an outcome that seemed almost inconceivable after ten minutes when Horncastle had raced into a 2-0 lead and were moving the ball around slickly.
The game began inauspiciously when poor marking at a long corner allowed a Horncastle forward time and space to undercut a sizzler past Steve Parker in the South goal; indeed, the ball was in and out of the net so fast that umpires Kevin Pride and Jim Sutcliffe had to play back the mental slow-mos a few times before confirming what had happened. Almost immediately after the restart, Richard Morgan limped off with a twisted knee, prompting the first of several positional rearrangements which saw skipper Jim Thorpe reverting to his more traditional role of centre-back.
Working overtime, though, Thorpe popped up at the far end to strike South's first short after a storming run by John Taylor had been ended by an obstruction. Thorpe got plenty of wood and just the right elevation on the shot but the keeper did well to palm it down from a lying position. Then, after a neat little threesome involving Ryan Thomas, Franois Lemoine and Chris Baker had been prematurely terminated, it was Horncastle's turn at the setpiece and they made the most of their chance, sending an unstoppable drag-flick just inside the right-hand post on the ten minute mark.
With South under the cosh, Lemoine, Thomas and Andy Rose had to pull out all the stops to prevent further damage, then Parker relieved the pressure with a firm and well-directed kick out past the Horncastle vanguard. South appeared to be adapting to the faster pace when Thorpe channelled a pass forward to Lemoine, who first-timed it to Taylor, but after the consistently excellent Chris Graveling had jumped in for a key interception, Horncastle were in the D again with their awkward reverse-hander, who caused problems throughout, bearing down on goal. This time Parker robbed him with a swingeing tackle and the play switched rapidly through Lemoine, with Thorpe releasing Baker for a confident drive into the D which forced a clearance. Moments later, Baker again angled it forcefully into the circle and Thomas, with a true poacher's instinct, seized on the pass and one-timed it sweetly past the outstretched keeper to reduce the deficit on fifteen minutes.
Further shots by Matt Murray and Doug Leckie, again capitalising on Baker's busy work in the Horncastle 25, were adroitly blocked before Taylor slid one across the face of the goal from Leckie's pass. In the seventeenth minute, Horncastle had a golden opportunity to extend their lead when Mark Freer, who had earlier shown some composure at right-back, tweaked a hamstring on the stretch and had to pull up short as his man got away. But keeper Parker was again to the rescue with a well-judged spread tackle which took enough of the way off the ball for Graveling to effect a late recovery.
Then South, spurred on by the excitement, equalised on eighteen minutes when the skilful Leckie finessed up the right flank and worked the ball into the circle, where the predatory Taylor, recovering his touch, dived in to score as the ball ran loose.
Horncastle, temporarily discomfited, were forced onto the back foot for the next ten minutes as South for once held the whip hand. Urged on by a vociferous Matt Bailey - positional adviser, chief French interpreter and umpiring assessor rolled into one and all topped off with a fetching woollen tea-cosy - South worked it elegantly round the back as Leckie nonchalantly controlled a Barnes Wallis pass from a deeply apologetic Graveling, and then Thomas and Baker combined to gain a short. Thorpe's artful topper had the goalie scrambling uneasily to his left to save but Leckie's shot from the rebound was diverted off a stick.
Baker and Alex Pooles kept up the heat and, following another sleight-of-hand interception from the ubiquitous Graveling, South hassled well to win a third short on twenty-four minutes. Thorpe's switch allowed Baker (twice) and Leckie to shoot but there was no joy, and Thorpe and the versatile Thomas, now playing a slightly deeper role and defending with interest, had to track back smartly to cover their lines. Taylor then sold a Horncastle midfielder a classic nutmeg on halfway as the visitors wriggled uncomfortably; Leckie and Baker posed a constant threat round the D and Pooles, taking over from Rose on the left as the latter dropped back, showed a clean pair of heels up the wing.
But after Taylor - who enjoys playing for South so much that he's got himself posted to Siberia for a month - had put the frighteners on a Horncastle defender in the right corner, the pendulum began to swing as the Lincolnshire side started to find their feet again. On thirty minutes, Parker had to confront a lone attacker and his well-timed dive engineered a long enough detour for Thorpe to cover on the line; then, within a minute, he had to spreadeagle himself to beat out a crashing shot with Horncastle two-on-one and the defence AWOL. After this let-off, South were glad to cling on desperately till half-time, with the visitors dominant round the circle and the ball proving as elusive to the home defence as the Golden Snitch.
The second period started off in the same vein as Parker was faced with another one-on-one; on this occasion, he got close into the attacker's feet, forcing a halt and a hasty scoop which went wide. A reverse-stick dive from a Horncastle forward just failed to connect but the South keeper was soon back in the action with a kick to the wings and then a magnificent diving block after standing up to the striker to the last minute. South rallied in a fast and furious exchange as Graveling, Pooles and Baker zipped the ball crossfield to Murray, but Horncastle kept finding ways through and round the defence and, after a giveaway just outside the D and a period of bagatelle just inside, Parker was caught slightly off-balance as a ballooning short-range effort crept in to give the visitors the lead on forty-four minutes.
South made a spirited reply as Taylor - returning from a quick breather made possible by sub John Benedikz - soon forced the keeper to save to his left and then swapped passes with Pooles to maintain the pressure. Graveling brought some order to the defence with good distribution and supremely resolute tackling and, after shadowing a shot wide of goal, snuffed out a two-man break with a critical interception.
South's fourth short, on fifty minutes, broke down after Thorpe's switch and the to-and-fro continued as the quick-thinking Parker forced a Horncastle forward round onto his wrong side, drawing an exasperated miss. Thomas, a Trojan in midfield, showed his paces at this point, first clearing with a reverse and then feeding Murray, who painted his man into a corner before crossing to the centre. Two successive long corners promised a reward but a bulldog effort by Thorpe was somehow kept out and, despite Taylor and Leckie's persistence, Horncastle slipped the noose to set up a two-on-one which Parker coolly dismantled with a pinpoint clearance to the wing.
South were unlucky not to win a short on fifty-five minutes as the visitors packed their defence with Baker on the loose, but the ball emerged from a forest of guilty legs and Horncastle powered downfield to claim a short. The resulting drag-flick would have graced a team from several divisions higher and, though it whistled over the bar at a rate of knots, Horncastle soon made amends when South's defensive corps was left for dead and the ball was swept in with three men free in the D.
But Parker kept his team in the game, bringing off yet another ground-shuddering tackle in the next breath and then clearing the ball long to Taylor after Rose and Thomas had battled grimly in the D. Despite everything, South were not finished and Murray's constant badgering in the upper quadrant helped win a fifth short on sixty-one minutes. Thorpe's switch quickly led to a deflected reverse hit from Thomas which, cruelly, was stopped on the line and cleared with the goalie well beaten.
Taylor, Leckie and Baker all got close in the next three minutes and Thorpe strode forward on the drive but South were over-reliant on Graveling at the rear and, though he showed tremendous stamina and resilience, Parker was increasingly exposed to the rapacious Horncastle front-line. But the South keeper was equal to the task, again devouring a two-on-one with a superbly-timed block for Rose to clear and set Thomas up for a determined last assault in the dying minutes. Pooles, Lemoine and Taylor desperately tried to find a way through the barrage and Taylor nearly got a shot off on sixty-eight minutes as he used his elbows well to clear some space near the penalty spot. But South were running on empty now and, as Horncastle flooded upfield, it was left to Parker to keep the home goal intact in a fine solo effort, first staring out a one-on-one with a split-second dive and then finishing in a blaze as he angled away a vicious flick with an incredible stick save to his right.
Final analysis: though South could have no complaints about the result and the rearranged defence and midfield was sometimes overfaced by the sheer pace and organisation of the Horncastle front line, there was plenty of commitment and spirit in evidence and, if the side sticks religiously to its basic marking tasks, there is little doubt that progress can still be made.","Quelle surprise - Men's 1sts lose to Horncastle 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

We were up 1-0 for the first time, and the opposition looked shaken.
The feeling was short lived, however, when Wisbech managed to push through the defence of Ian Evans, Andy Passmore, Phil Le Gouais and Matt Bailey to beat keeper Steve Parker (doubling from the firsts game which only finished minutes before this one) and equalise the score: 1-1.
Not to be put off, Cambridge started the attack again, and the forwards Wilco Dijkstra and John Benedikz were placed nicely to allow Johnny B to put Cambridge up again at 2-1.
Unfortunately, Wisbech managed to equalise before half time, leaving it 2-2, but leaving the game well within the reach of either team.
South again started well, with Dave Best brought into midfield, but a skilful Wisbech forward pushed through and passed around the defence (now including Rodney Richardson) and took Wisbech into a lead which we didn't regain. South started to tire at the end and gave away two short corners within the last five minutes, but our defence held on strongly and the final score was 2-3 to Wisbech.

Considering the positional changes required, South did well to contain the thoroughbred City attack in the first ten minutes as the home side used the full width of the pitch and, though there were some giveaways and elementary errors from dead-ball positions, defensive linchpin Chris Graveling and the pragmatic Keith Simpson generally held their opponents in check. Doug Leckie dribbled nervelessly out of a tight corner on more than one occasion and, by the time South had won their first short after eight minutes, they had already had a good chance to score courtesy of a quick-thinking move involving Ryan Thomas, Rob Garrett and finally Andy Rose, who just skimmed the keeper before City averted the danger. Neither South's short nor City's first, which soon followed, came to anything but South continued to play positively despite some queasy moments at the rear. Veejay Agarwala was tenaciously skilful at left-half, Richard Morgan distributed crisply, and Rose and Thomas found each other with pleasing regularity to set up several promising situations.
When City threatened near the D on twelve minutes, Graveling's intimidating presence caused the ball-carrier to fall over spontaneously in a shower of arms and legs, but there were no such mistakes a couple of minutes later when City, adept throughout at drawing the foul, won the second of their eleven penalty corners. However, keeper Steve Parker, braced as ever for hard-core action, read the switch and made a good block to his right from a hard low strike to maintain the zero. South then launched a swift counter-attack after City's third short, and a slick sequence of passes from Agarwala, Simpson and skipper Jim Thorpe set the hard-running Thomas up for a shot which deserved more but just went wide. After Parker had calmly neutralised a sharp City attempt with a clearance to the wing, Thomas was on the warpath again and, after feeding Garrett, whose shot was half-stopped by the keeper, he slotted smartly into the second wave and stuffed away a close-range effort to notch his third goal in four games.
The play went coast-to-coast for the next ten minutes, with Parker putting in a pinpoint clearance to Agarwala before watching an angled cross deflect narrowly past a post. Garrett's extra pace - profitably used in his former right-wing mode - created chances up front as he interpassed with Thorpe and Thomas, and he nearly doubled the lead on twenty minutes as the City keeper was almost rounded. Then Parker effortlessly absorbed and despatched a piledriver from his right before diving up and across to parry a goalbound deflection. City continued to be difficult to dispossess in the D, but Morgan, Simpson and Graveling sensibly kept their heads and gradually wormed the ball out.
Rob Hay won a key tackle on the twenty-five and South had a golden opportunity when Rose, taking Hay's excellent pass, was clumsily fouled in City territory. But Thorpe's slip from the resulting short was not fully exploited and the keeper was able to clear safely. Although Rose, Graveling and Leckie all stood their ground in the face of mounting attacks, the fake gunshot from the local bird-scarer seemed to be a harbinger and, on thirty-three minutes, a snappy four-man move originating from City's left midfield had the South defence chasing shadows as an unmarked man raced in to finish clinically. After Garrett had been robbed at the death by a desperate diving tackle and Agarwala had once more spirited the ball out of a tricky spot in the left corner, Graveling and Parker between them ensured that there were no further problems before the break, Parker thwarting a City short with a fine diving stick-and-glove save for a long corner and Graveling tackling on the turn with devastating sleight of foot.
South, who according to at least one of the City subs were still leading 1-0 at this stage, started the second half with a series of simple, sensible moves initiated by Morgan and Graveling but conceded an ugly short after forty-one minutes and, from this, the home side took the lead when a direct strike, momentarily obscured from Parker's view, skimmed a glove on the way in. South came nerve-janglingly close to an equaliser almost immediately when super-sub Steve Fleck, scourge of many a local defence over the decades, burnt up the middle after great work by Thomas and Rose and courageously managed to get a firm shot off despite an imminent flattening from the City keeper. The ball was inches wide, to City's obvious relief, but this miss - and the set of bleeding knuckles which went with it - did not deter the terrier-like Irishman from injecting a welcome dash of devilment into the attack for the rest of the game.
South continued to try and build steadily, with Morgan in good touch and getting stuck in, but there were too many unforced errors, particularly from set plays, for the right sort of possession to be maintained for the necessary length of time. Nevertheless, Leckie came close to that elusive second goal when firing a flick into the side netting after forty-seven minutes, and the spirit was clearly good since City's subs were anxiously urging their men on to ""want it more"". Hay, Graveling and Parker firmly repelled a determined assault near the right-hand post, Morgan kept his purple patch going and City's seventh short was neatly snuffed out on each of the three occasions it was taken. A Graveling drive upfield nearly secured the breakthrough in the fifty-third minutes as he moved forward and Thorpe back, and Hay's interception gave Leckie the opportunity to demonstrate the fancy stuff before igniting Fleck, whose cross just missed the onrushing Thomas. A further two shorts were seen off, to City's evident frustration, before Leckie embarked on another juggernaut run which left five opponents trailing in his wake. But after Garrett and Thomas had successfully funnelled the ball up the left, City took advantage of a two-man collision in the South midfield to create a cast-iron chance just inside the D which was again coolly slotted away despite Parker's best efforts, to give the home side a 3-1 lead with ten minutes to go.
South, though refusing to panic, could make little headway over the next five minutes as Thomas and Fleck, working overtime to get a result from good ball from Thorpe and Agarwala, were stymied by the resolute City defence whenever they threatened to make inroads. Simpson, returning for the final phase, tackled with good sense and judgment, as did Morgan, but, in the dying moments, it was once again left to Parker to keep the scoreline respectable as he beat out two stinging shorts, one with a resolute diving block and stick clearance and the other with an inch-perfect raised pad save on the whistle.","Same old story - Men's 1sts lose to Cambridge City 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

The away team dominated from the start, and only solid defending, particularly from John Benedikz at sweeper, kept them at bay. The opening goal came against the run of play from a slick Greaves-Lewis short corner routine, with Andy Lewis rifling his shot in from the edge of the D. Sadly this only served to irritate Deeping, who scored three goals in quick succession, mainly due to their quick thinking forwards and the home team being unable to clear the ball rapidly and effectively.
The second half was a similar story. Deeping got a fourth goal and were only prevented from scoring more by some great goalmouth stops from newcomer Nik Oettle and Steve Lane. South came back strongly towards the end, inspired by MoM Nick Wong, who buzzed around in defence, midfield and attack, and the catalytic effect of a couple of substitutions. Wong almost got on the scoresheet a number of times before he managed to pass decisively across goal for John Greaves to turn the ball neatly past the keeper for a trademark three-yarder.
This was not enough to get back into the game, and Deeping got a lucky final goal via a deflection wrongfooting the otherwise solid keeper, John Bartram.
It was good to see CSouth keep going to the end, not giving up, and exploiting different attacking avenues, but inability to win enough 50/50 balls, too frequently giving the ball away in our own half, from set and open play and not covering sixteen yard hits cost us dear.","Men's 2nds lose Market Deeping 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

It didn't take long for South to start hurting themselves. Practising short corners with both attack and defence during the warm-up, defender Sam Lansdell rushed out towards receiver James Bridge, then came around the wrong side and found his head connecting with the end of Bridge's swinging stick. Blood began to flow from a cut on Lansdell's right eyebrow, and it was apparent that hospital treatment was required. Following some negotiation, captain David Bridge took Lansdell to hospital, where he had six stitches and is now recovering well. This left South a man down: umpire Andy Lewis stepped into the team, and St Neots kindly provided a second umpire. James Bridge took over the captaincy.
The match began after a short delay with South starting with only ten men, as Lewis was still getting changed, and joining soon after. The sides were fairly even to begin with: St Neots played a good passing game, with South focussing more on dribbling the ball up the pitch and trying long passes towards the forward pair of Wilco Dijkstra and David Scott. Both sides had a number of attacks: one South attack resulted in a long corner, which unfortunately hit a St Neots defender in the leg for the second injury of the match, although the player was able to continue after a short rest. Similarly, a St Neots passing attack up the centre involved a strong tackle by midfielder Chris Clegg, during which the attacker's stick whacked solidly into Clegg's knee for yet another injury, although he could also continue playing after a pause.
The South defence of Steve Morrell, Sam Carr, Ian Evans (taking injured Lansdell's place) and led by a strong Ky Ho, stood firm against St Neots attacks until a freak goal after about twenty minutes. A long fast ball into the centre of South's D was miscontrolled by a St Neots attacker, to fly up off his stick into the top right corner of the South goal. The South pain was doubled less than a minute later: St Neots regained possession after the restart and immediately passed the ball up to their attackers, who neatly slotted the ball away for a second goal. South were understandably dismayed by this sudden two goal deficit, but managed to hang on for the rest of the first half.
Following the restart, Dijkstra and Lewis changed positions, with Dijkstra dropping back to left wing and Lewis moving up as a striker. St Neots restarted strongly, putting pressure on the South defence and gaining a series of short corners. One of these resulted in a shot on goal, which defender Ho got a stick to, but unfortunately only enough to deflect the ball past keeper Tom James and into the goal, for St Neots' third of the afternoon.
With fifteen minutes of the match left, Matt Murray arrived to bolster the team following a phone call from departed David Bridge, and came on to replace Lewis (who had already played one match today). The arrival of Murray served as a catalyst for South to lift their game, showing no signs of tiring (which has been a problem towards the end of matches earlier in the season).
The South midfield of Tim Gass, James Bridge, Chris Clegg, and Wilco Dijkstra produced some good link-up play and attacked the St Neots defence with renewed vigour, which culminated in a short corner. Dijkstra pushed out to Bridge, who, in a pre-arranged routine, passed the ball left to Murray, who unleashed a shot that found the St Neots goal. South continued to press hard for the last five minutes, but in the end the pressure had simply come too late.","Men's 3rds lose to St Neots 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

The result - a 5-1 defeat - was a fair reflection of the current standing of the two sides and, for most of the game, South were hard pressed to keep their keen, well-organised visitors at bay. Rob Hay made a goal line save in the second minute, keeper Steve Parker had to pull out all the stops after the defence got itself into trouble in the third minute and, overall, South found great difficulty in putting any really joined-up moves together, although the long-striding Rob Garrett was twice able to round the Bourne goalie before running out of time and space.
Occasional flashes of inspiration, such as when Veejay Agarwala took on and beat five men with the ball glued to his stick or when Chris Graveling made a superb jinking run from defence, were not enough to break down concerted spells of pressure from the confident Bourne attack, who thrived on sustained periods of possession.
The visitors were 2-0 up at half-time and, seeking to reinforce their advantage over nearest rivals Ely and Horncastle, looked to step on the jugular after the break. South had to absorb relentless pressure at the back, with Graveling and Keith Simpson doing their best to stem the bleeding after Bourne had gone 3-0 ahead on thirty-seven minutes, but there was little respite as two further open-play goals were swept past the beleaguered defence with fifteen minutes still to play. South's scoring threat hitherto had been limited to a Jim Thorpe short corner and another Garrett special - hit just wide after he had evaded a full-on challenge from the keeper - but some consolation was at hand when Chris Baker raced through and slotted home a good hard drive into the bottom left-hand corner after fifty-nine minutes.
The game finished without further addition on either side, leaving Bourne top of the pile and South mustering their collective will for the second half of the season, which starts next weekend with an away trip to Long Sutton, the mercurial Lincolnshire side with whom South drew in the opening fixture back in September.","Oh dear, Men's 1sts lose yet again, this time to Bourne 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Two first half goals came from straightforward short corner routines, first from Andy Lewis, and shortly after from Raphael Mis, both with unstoppable efforts from distance.
Further South chances followed in the second half, but were sadly unconverted. Spalding snatched a goal back, and as CSHC tired and suffered some unfortunate injuries which slowed down the players concerned, turned the game, mainly through their playmaker in central midfield. They got the equaliser through sheer persistance and ability to get numbers into the D. Goalkeeper Jon Bartram was called upon more and more to repel shots, and sweeper Steve Riches tried manfully to shore up the defence.

They were swiftly 2-0 up, the first goal arriving after two minutes when they retrieved a breakdown at a short corner and ping-ponged the ball round the D for a classic short-range strike and the second resulting from a fluke deflection that looped in just under the bar. South had not been without their chances, however, as Steve Fleck, Jim Thorpe from a short and Doug Leckie from the rebound had all forced the Sutton keeper into action.
But South always looked vulnerable and, before fifteen minutes were up, keeper Steve Parker had already had to put in two crunching tackles with the odds heavily stacked against him and Leckie had made a gallant double save on the goal-line to hold the home side at bay. The upper lip was kept fairly stiff over the next ten minutes as Thorpe and Chris Baker fed the busy Fleck for another shot on target and the rangy Rob Garrett nearly scored to the keeper's right; Parker then dismissed a dangerous cross to the wing and Veejay Agarwala set up a number of promising moves involving Baker, Mark Freer and the hard-working Ryan Thomas, who had nobly stayed on after the end of the university term to sample the rare delights of the northern fens.
Despite Chris Graveling's tireless work at the back, Sutton always looked to have the wherewithal to break through and this they did with a superbly-timed reverse shot on twenty-five minutes. Worse was to follow as an unmarked attacker gleefully converted a perfect cross to make it 4-0 and, though South once more hit the goalie with a good short after Thomas had narrowly failed to reach a ball teetering on the Sutton line, the home side conclusively wrapped up the half with a straight-through-the-middle fifth goal which emphasised their individual determination and will to win.
A rout threatened when Sutton's sixth goal, again marked by an absence of defensive cover, went in almost immediately after the break but South pulled back from the brink, winning a series of five short corners in as many minutes. From the fourth, Agarwala's neat angled push to the far post from Thorpe's switch found Fleck, who steered it cannily over the keeper to open South's account on forty-three minutes. Thomas went close on the next and South engineered a decent stretch of play when Agarwala, Garrett and Baker began to produce some crisp, one-time link-ups with good pace and vision.
Fleck shot just wide on fifty-five minutes, then South won another three shorts in quick succession but all of them drew regulation saves. Parker blocked a hard shot from the left of the circle on sixty-three minutes, and Graveling, Freer and John Benedikz - selflessly making the journey north in spite of illness - held firm on Sutton's other forays beyond the South twenty-five until the hosts won a fifth and final short a minute or so from the end. This was driven wide (as far as the sepulchral floodlighting would allow your correspondent to judge) but the result had been sealed long ago with that decisive first-half performance.","Groundhog day - Men's 1's losing streak continues against Long Sutton 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Keeper Jon Bartram, playing with his usual authority, kept other efforts out, and generally dominated his area.
The home team came straight back into the game as the rapid Mark Reilly crossed to Finn Johnson, whose shot rebounded off the post only for Tim Waller to pounce gleefully.
At this stage the game was evenly matched, with both sides attacking well. After half time South went ahead from their usual well worked short corner routine as a Stuart Creed thunderbolt just inside the near post gave the goalkeeper no chance. Man of the match Creed and his fellow central midfielder Tim Waller continued to prompt home attacks and make themselves a nuisance to the opposition.
The clinching goal was a result of persistant attacking in numbers, with Reilly and Finn Johnson combining well for Finn to score with a reverse stick shot after Long Sutton failed to clear. Long Sutton did come back near the end and an unmarked forward was able to snatch a goal from close in, but South held out for a fine win.
A good overall performance in a game played in good spirit, with everyone playing their part, in spite of having a significantly reshaped team in all departments.

This was due to a 4pm push-back, the fact that a third of the flood spots were not working and the infamous fen fog. Combine this with darkish green (Long Sutton) and greyish black (Cambridge South) shirts, indistinguishable in the ambiance lighting, and the match became decidedly foggy to watch, even for the players!
However, despite what the final score-line of 30 may suggest, it was a good match. My task was to organise the roll-on/roll-off of the substitute. We travelled with twelve players who were all 3rd team players, unlike our opposition who fielded one 1st team player and two 2nd team players. This was noticeable as those three players seem to control strategic areas on the pitch.
The game was certainly not one-sided. We played a good passing game, Sean would have been proud of us, and certainly created some good chances which unfortunately we were unable to convert into points, also because Long Sutton have a very able goalkeeper.
Lino, our goalie, very much did his bit to keep the score-line down. Some terrific safes were made by him. Our defence team of stalwart Ky Ho, Phil Le Gouais, Andy Passmore and Steve Morrell ably assisted him. Ky was very strong in defence, making tackle after tackle and pushing up once or twice.
Tim Gass, David Bridge and Sam Lansdell were working hard in midfield, disrupting the Long Sutton attack with determined tackling and hassling. Sam, in the centre, was particularly good in connecting with the forwards of David Scott, George Bucknall and initially Wilco Dijkstra who tested the Long Sutton defence. We kept the forwards fresh by substituting every eight or nine minutes so Tom James came on for Wilco etc.
Long Sutton kept pushing however and the experience and skill of their 1st and 2nd team players started to count and they managed to score two goals in the first half from some smooth and skilful running with the ball and good passing. We made some minor changes in the second half which resulted in even better passing and more forward play, really pushing hard for a goal. We let in one more goal from a breakaway move by Long Sutton but came away feeling quite pleased with ourselves for our effort, determination and generally improved play.","Men's 3rds lose to Long Sutton 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

March then snuck in another goal just before the interval, in spite of stand-in keeper Lino's best efforts.
The second half was different. South had numerous attacks and were unlucky not to score from open play and corners.
March were not unlucky. They took advantage of complete brain-fade of the away team, who gave the ball away and allowed March to go through tackles with ease, and score at will ten times.

At that stage the away team were more than a match for Broxbourne, with new midfield combination of Tony Wiskich and Ryan Thomas running amok, and distributing the ball well to the forwards and wings who were able to test the defence frequently. The South defence were solid and positive in clearing the ball away and getting sixteen yard hits beyond the ring.
Broxbourne were fortunate to grab an equaliser and just before half time they snuck in a bobbler from a short corner to take the lead.
The second half started okay, with another goal from each team - the South one came from a short corner, as Mark Reilly pounced on a Ryan Thomas cross/shot. Unfortunately after fifteen mins the wheels came off ; 50/50 balls became lost causes, attacks fizzled out with poor final balls, and Broxbourne took command. They scored a rapid double as South, battling to stay in the game, were caught in possession too many times in our own half. A final goal near the end rubbed salt into the wound.
The spaghetti bolognese and garlic bread afterwards were good, and the Broxbourne crew were understandably chirpy.
South 2nds will have to address those second half failings if we are to climb up the table.

George Bucknall showed the rest of the team how we should be playing, putting himself in good attacking positions and showing composure on the ball. David Bridge, playing left midfield was also managing to find some space out wide. However, for the first twenty minutes or so neither side really looked like scoring. South's defence of Steve Morrell, Andy Passmore, Sam Lansdell and Neil Sneade looked to have all under control.
The deadlock was unfortunately broken by March Town. A fairly scrappy goal put them one up. South then had a nightmare fifteen minute period. George Bucknall took a knock and had to be subbed off, then David Bridge's back gave up. Luckily, South had two reinforcements (Tim Gass and captain Rod Richardson), but this was not enough to stop two March goals going in, in quick succession.
It was soon looking like another horrible drubbing for South, but in the nick of time several players picked up their game. Chris Clegg, playing at central mid, started to provide the forward players with some good balls. Andy Kennedy seemed to have the better of his marker on the right hand side and came very close to scoring from a quickly taken free hit. [The near miss still haunts him  Ed.]
However, it was James Bridge who managed to find the back of the net. Taking the ball into the D, he seemed to have the impossible task of having two defenders and a very large guy with a lot of padding (aka the goalkeeper) in between him and the goal. However, a reverse stick shot at an impossibly acute angle somehow surprised everyone and came to a rest in the goal. At 3-1 South suddenly had a glimmer of hope going into the second half.
Both teams picked up their game in the second half. Sam Lansdell and Neil Sneade were coming forward well from defence and Andy Kennedy and Wilco Dijkstra were putting some promising moves together. Generally, the team was passing much better. Tom James in goal was kept busy and made some very good saves, but it was unfortunately March Town that managed to polish off their win with another well taken goal.

South's first half performance was one of their better efforts of the season and they could have had the game wrapped up by half-time, if not for the inspired form of the St Ives keeper.
The first clear chance came in the fifth minute, when Andy Rose won a tackle in midfield, moved the ball forwards to Alex Pooles, who slipped Nick Wong in, one-on-one. However the keeper was out fast and smothered Nick's shot. A minute later South came close again, when Phil Hunt played a ball down the left channel for Alex to sweep goalwards, again drawing a good save from the keeper. After ten minutes the St Ives keeper was at it again, making a high glove save to turn away Nick's flick of Phil's driven free hit.
St Ives had their first threatening moment of the match in the twelfth minute, when winning a short. keeper Anush Newman, making his South debut, saved the shot, only to see the ball get stuck under his pads for another short. From this, Anush again made a good save and the St Ives forward's attempt to knock in the rebound went wide.
After this slight scare, South went back on the attack and in the seventeenth minute created another good chance with a neat move. Nick picked up the ball on the right wing, beat his player with a typical spin move, swapped passes cleverly with Ryan Thomas, but again the shot was smothered by the onrushing keeper. Then, in the twenty-first minute, a South short corner was switched to Rob Hay on the right, his shot was blocked but ran free in the direction of Ryan, who just couldn't apply the finishing touch, the ball going wide.
Having tried sweeping moves and shorts, in the twenty-fifth minute South then attempted weight of numbers. After Phil had seen a shot blocked, Ryan lifted a reverse stick flick over the prone keeper, but the ball was cleared off the line as Nick threw himself at it in an attempt to force home.
After all these chances had come and gone, it was a relief when a goal finally arrived in the thirty-third minute. Another good driving run by Phil played in Alex down the right channel. His shot was half-blocked by the St Ives keeper but ran free to Ryan, arriving at the right place and right time, a yard out in the centre of the goal, from where he couldnt miss.
In the final minute of the half, St Ives produce a rare threatening moment for the South defence, winning a short after a poor attempted tackle by centre back Rob Garrett. Again, Anush was equal to the driven shot, and the rebound went wide, leaving South one up at half time, but wondering whether it shouldn't have been more.
These worries should have been put to bed when South doubled their lead within the first fifteen seconds of the second half. From a St Ives push-back, Chris Baker made a good tackle and broke with the ball down the right-wing. He feed the ball into the D, where Nick jinked past his marker, only to have the ball taken off him by a tackle deliberately made with the back stick, prompting the St Ives umpire to award a penalty flick. Ryan took on the responsibility, and sent his flick high down the middle, giving the diving St Ives keeper no chance.
However, instead of giving South the cushion to go on to win the match, this goal appeared to breed some complacency. The defence of Mark Freer, Rob Garrett, Francois Lemoine and Rich Morgan, who had been so cool and comfortable in the first half, were suddenly under pressure with St Ives runners coming from all angles. In the forty-third minute, St Ives pulled one goal back when a runner down the right channel was allowed to get all the way to the byline. From there, a driven cross took an unfortunate deflection off a South body to fly high into the net, giving Anush no chance.
Then two minutes later, the scores were level, and forty minutes' good work had gone to waste. A ball was driven into the South D, ricocheted about for an agonising few seconds, wasn't cleared, and was eventually swept home by the familiar figure of former South vice-captain and top scorer Rob Barton, on his first return in St Ives colours. South's appeals for an infringement in the build-up fell on deaf ears.
South nearly retook the lead in the forty-seventh minute when a short corner was driven in by Rob Hay, and Alex added a neat flick, which unfortunately flashed over the bar. St Ives's reaction to this was to take the lead themselves three minutes later. An attack down the South left found a forward unmarked in the D. His shot drew a great save from Anush, but the ball ran free, and that man Barton again swept the loose ball home with a trademark reverse stick shot.
In the fifty-second minute, South drew probably the best save of the match from the St Ives keeper, as they went about trying to reverse those seven minutes of madness. Andy Rose drove a ball in from the left, Alex touched it towards the centre of goal, then Nick deflected it at the bottom left corner from close range, the keeper showing lightening reactions to kick the ball out for a long corner.
With time running out, St Ives began to sit back and try to hold onto their lead. This invited South on to them and, in the sixty-third minute, South took advantage to level. Francois Lemoine picked up a loose ball on the left flank, and cracked a good cross across the face of goal. Nick Wong's reactions were sharper than his markers, and he got to the ball at the back post to turn it home.
As a draw was of little use to either side, play now got stretched into an end-to-end affair, and in the sixty-sixth minute South won a short corner. Finally, a routine functioned completely smoothly, giving Chris Baker the time to aim his drive at the bottom right corner of the net and put South back into the lead they had so carelessly lost.
With so little time remaining, St Ives threw bodies forwards to try and equalise, but the best chance of the remaining time came South's way when a flowing counter attack begun by Rob Garrett went via Alex, Phil and Chris down the right wing and saw Alex played in for a shot. The St Ives keeper returned to the theme of the first half with a good block and Nick couldn't turn the rebound onto the target.
A few more desperate attempts by St Ives were comfortably thwarted by the South defence, and that first league win was secured. Captain for the day Andy Rose's post match comment was ""We wanted it more"", and your correspondent agrees that the way the team fought back to win, after seemingly having let a very winnable match slip, was a positive.

Though South can stand disappointed at not bringing away the three points, they can hold their heads high after probably their best passing and tactical game played all season.
South started with an early advantage as one of the Horncastle players showed a bit of gender confusion and went to Perse Boys instead of Perse Girls, lending South a one man advantage for most of the first ten minutes. Some great set-up play from the Bridge brothers at left back and left mid began some easy breaks and it seemed that getting the ball anywhere near Andy Kennedy, as the other left mid, guaranteed the ball getting at least to the D.
Ten minutes in, and Horncastle cheekily started playing with a full team (the cads), getting themselves back into the game for a while. A bruising segment of the match calmed down when South found their width, finding bountiful space and passing opportunities in midfield. You could be forgiven for thinking that it was Arsene Wenger standing on the sidelines yelling advice, and not captain Rod Richardson, unfortunately sidelined with a serious case of the sniffles [Oy!  Ed].
After hammering the Horncastle D for a time, one of these sweeping actions finally paid off. Piecing together recollections, the ball seems to have covered the entire pitch, going via Ky Ho (sweeper), Steve Morrell (right back), Dave Scott (centre right mid), James Bridge (centre left mid) and finally on to Andy Kennedy (left mid), who decided against passing it around to Wilco or George and instead just went for plan B, whacking it into the corner of the goal from just inside the perimeter. On a good day for South, this kind of fluid passing action was happily proving the norm.
Horncastle fought back with gusto after this, laying siege to the South defence for a period with a rush of short corners. The shorts were coming so thick and fast that the South midfielders complained afterwards that their gallant efforts to sprint from the line to aid the defence, were starting to resemble a bleep test as they had to turn and run back as soon as they got halfway there, only to sprint again seconds later. Despite the barrage, the determined efforts of Tom James in goal, aided by the sticks (and on occasions, feet) of Ky Ho, David Bridge, Paul McIlwaine and Steve Morrell, maintained a clean sheet for the first half.
The second half continued even better for South, as the midfield of Andy, James, David Scott and Tim Gass moved the ball around with nary a piece of Horncastle wood getting to it. Wilco Dijkstra and George Bucknall continued to lay siege to the Horncastle keeper with support from the midfield, and came several times within inches of scoring, but to no joy.
In comparison to South's domination of the midfield, at the other end Horncastle were relying on long balls to try to release players on the break, but South's smothering of the forwards combined with Tom's heroics in goal denied any reward from these. Indeed, Horncastle's best two open play chances of the half came when a long ball found its way through a forest of feet and sticks and the forwards themselves were so surprised by the balls sudden emergence that nothing came of it.
Unfortunately the glut of short corners eventually paid off for Horncastle, and after an entire match of taking shots from the top if the D as soon as possible, the receiver finally changed tactics and passed the ball past Paul and Steve's sprint to the injector, who struck a powerful shot into the goal, taking the score to 1-1.
The remainder of the match was played out in tense scenes, as neither team wanted to give up such a hard fought game on an easy goal. Despite Cambridge's dominance of the midfield, the uprights and the goalie managed to keep the ball out of the Horncastle net, as both sides were hampered by an increasingly low sun blinding them.
In the end, hearts were in mouths as Horncastle's entire team came up for a match-ending short corner, but the homicidal charge of the South defence denied the visitors a potentially heart-breaking last minute winner. A 1-1 draw is better than a loss (though the complexities of this scoring system had to be explained to the author in the pub afterwards, as he didn't quite get this), and things are only getting better for the team.","Men's 3rds draw with Horncastle 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Peterborough went ahead in the first half when a penalty corner strike was cruelly deflected off a defender's stick and looped high over the diving keeper, dropping into the back of the goal.
Ten minutes into the second half, Peterborough struck again when loose play out of defence resulted in a break. The first shot was stopped well by keeper Anush Newman in goal but the ball fell back to the feet of the attacker who coolly lifted it over the keeper and into the net.

Which we did, especially the courageous Sam Lansdell, who managed to head butt an opposition stick after three mins. The stick won. Sam returned towards the end of the match minus some blood, but plus stitches, after a rapid visit to Addenbrookes A & E with Dr Murray.
The first half was evenly matched with few chances. The Cambridge South defence were solid; John Benedikz was masterful at sweeper, showing the right aggressive spirit and firm defending required to repel the skilful and organised Peterborough attack and our increasingly confident keeper, Lino Di Lorenzo, was stopping the ball with all parts of his anatomy. Tim Waller was constantly in the action, tracking back and causing Peterborough problems on the left wing.
Peterborough snuck ahead after the interval, first from an unstoppable effort into the roof of the net straight from a cross and then from a breakaway attack through the outnumbered South defence after a goalmouth scramble at the opposite end had left the returned Matt Murray lying prone on the deck.
The two goal deficit did not deter the home team and pressure was rewarded when a firm Brynjolffssen pass into the D was pulled back across goal by skipper Greaves for the lurking Benedikz to slot home gleefully. Although only ten minutes were left, South kept up their attacks, showing greatly improved fitness and resolve than before Christmas. The final action of the game delivered a deserved equaliser, as South won a last short corner which was well worked from Greaves to Raphael, whose subtle (mis-)hit came back to Greaves, who blasted the ball firmly into the net.

Possession was roughly even and the ball spent about the same amount of time at each end, but it was Nomads who were making more of their opportunities.
There were some brilliant interceptions and runs up the field by Nik, Paul, Ky and Steve, but at other times South's defence seemed a fraction slow in getting rid of the ball when it was in danger areas. Nomads capitalised on this by scoring twice from short corners and once from open play.
On the attacking side, South could not quite finish. A couple of great crosses from Ali Blake wasted their sweetness on the desert air. A good shot from Wilco went just wide of the goal. A rapidly taken free hit by Wilco was received by David at the top of the D, but then thrown away as he allowed it to brush his body in an attempt to control it.
In the second half, South, in absence of reserves, refreshed the team by moving the wing backs (Nik & Steve) into midfield while Tim and David dropped back into defence.
South came out fighting and enjoyed the run of play for the first five minutes of the second half, with again a couple of tantalising missed opportunities. However, Nomads achieved a short corner on the break which was converted into a goal on the sixth minute, the ball slipping inside the left post.
South fought back hard and were rewarded four minutes later with a short corner of their own. Wilco swept the ball out to James who scooped it high towards the top right of the goal. The goalie's glove just got to it but it bounced off to the feet of Nik Oettle who finished the job with a perfect flick.
Nomads threw on their reserves but it was South who now dominated the midfield with sterling work by Finn, Nik, James and Steve. Indeed so dominant were South at times that their entire defence apart from the keeper crossed the halfway line to back up the assault on the opposition D.

St Neots were rattled and stayed rattled for the rest of the game. South strengthened in midfield, took control in the rest of the first half and doubled their lead through an Alex Pooles special, having been worked into a scoring position by the silky skills of Douglas Leckie.

From there South defended slightly better against increasing pressure from the home side.

The defence barely saw the ball, but when they did, the capable defence of Nik Oettle, Phil Le Gouais, Paul McIlwaine and Francois Lemoine deftly took it off St Ives and sent it back towards the other goal. Another goal by James Bridge took us to 3-0 at half-time, the highest score we had seen so far. We tasted victory, and it tasted good!
Whether it was overconfidence on our part, or the fact they brought on a new, very good player as their centre forward, we didn't fare as well in the second half. After giving away a short corner, their centre forward deftly flicked the ball into the goal, making it 3-1.
Not to be deterred, Cambridge struck back, make several well executed plays into the opposition's D, but unfortunately the shorts went wide or were stopped. One shot (from a short corner) was even stopped by the opposition foot on the goal line - which merely resulted in another short corner.
A much more evenly matched second half saw St Ives score again (I think from a short corner), leaving Cambridge a little shaken and seeing that the guaranteed victory could be snatched from them in the remaining ten minutes. So they picked up their game with strong attacking plays, and a good defence, keeping St Ives on their toes until the last minute.","Men's 3rds beat St Ives 5","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

South eventually went ahead after fifteen minutes when Alex Pooles finished neatly when a ball went loose in the Nomads D. Several other chances went begging and it was South that led into the break.
In the second half Nomads came out fighting and a scramble in the South D ended badly as a defender fell in front of goal and the ball fell to a Nomads player, who dribbled it into the fallen defender with the Umpire awarding a flick, much to South's surprise. Keeper Lino Di Lorenzo was expecting a quality flick to his left but got a weak one to his right. 1-1 and South were on the back foot.
The final blow came when a dubious short corner was finished smartly to give Nomads the lead. Another winnable game went the wrong way for the luckless Cambridge South who will surely be looking for stronger leadership next season.

South started confidently, with central midfielders Stuart Creed and Steve Fleck driving the team forward and wide midfielders Marston and Lewis causing trouble for Ely down the flanks. The pressure soon told, with Will Marston pouncing on a Raph Mis bobbler off a short corner to score the opening goal. Indeed there could have been more goals, but too often the final ball didn't reach a player in a goalscoring position.
The South defence stood firm and managed to repel most attacks before Ely could get close to the D. When they did, man of the match and sweeper John Benedikz in particular was on hand to take command and dispatch the ball upfield away from opposition attackers.
The second half continued in the same vein, although the home team were fortunate to have substitutes on hand as injuries struck down some key players. This didn't disrupt the team as everyone adjusted seamlessly to the resulting changes. Victory was assured as centre forward Mark Reilly got on the end of the best move of the match to slam home South's second goal.
Ely City tried hard to salvage something from the game towards the end, but South played intelligently to deny them any real chances.
This was a deserved and essential win, which will give South 2nds encouragement for the run in to the end of the season.

Half time came and with more determination South went about getting back into the match. After sustained periods of good pressure the breakthrough came when Chris Baker and Ryan Thomas combined to set up John Taylor for a well earned goal. The comeback was short lived, however, as St Ives rallied and their skilful forwards opened up the South defence again for another couple of quick goals.

The first came from the Greaves-Lewis routine, with John Greaves's near post effort rebounding off the keeper for Andy Lewis to smash the ball in for an unstoppable goal. The second was a result of some Mis magic, as Will Marston fed Raph Mis the ball for him to befuddle the defence before calmly placing it in the net from distance.
St Ives were stung into action and managed to get back on equal terms as their experienced midfield and central attackers got into gear with smooth passing moves carving through the away defence to score twice.
After half time St Ives dominated but South battled away, with John Benedikz again leading the back line by example from sweeper. Unfortunately, South were unable to create many chances as attacks fizzled out before getting into the danger area all too often, in spite of Mis's and Lewis's best efforts to get through and Tim Waller's and Will Marston's battling in midfield.
The home team had most of the pressure and got three more goals as South started to lose shape and run around after the ball. Towards the end South came back into the game as St Ives got a little complacent and were unlucky not to get another goal from an excellent Lewis free hit, which was turned into the net by Neil Sneade from close range only to be ruled out on a (correct) technicality.
This was Raph Mis's final game for the South 2nds and he again showed his blend of skills, commitment, full use of the murkier end of the Belgian language and magic touch near goal. He will be missed. Thanks.

The match went much as could be expected. In the first half Horncastle had eight shots and scored six goals (one shot went wide, the other hit a player's arm). There were periods of promise as Francois Lemoine and Ryan Thomas combined well in midfield, enabling Alex Pooles and Veejay Agarwala to uncover weaknesses in the opposition back line.
A neat move up the pitch by South put Argarwala into the D and he set up Pooles for an exquisite finish. The goal came much to the surprise of most participants in the game. So 6-1 down at half time but not without promise. Unfortunately, the six goal comeback failed to materialise as Horncastle demonstrated much better ball possession in the second half and controlled the game for long periods.
Andy Bleach gathered in confidence as the game went on, making a couple of good saves, but it was only his third game in goal. The 3rd team stand-ins, Finn Johnson and Sam Carr, showed commendable commitment throughout.

South started the game strongly and dominated possession and territory in the opening ten minutes. Centre forward Matt Murray was seeing a lot of the ball in these earlier stages and, from his intelligent prompting, Mark Reilly found space for a flicked shot which looked like it had potential, only for the March keeper to pull off a neat save.
With March's coach shouting from the touchline for his team to snap out of their lethargy and wake up, the rest of the half was far more even. March continued to lie deep allowing South most of the play, attempting to hit back on the fast break. South's scrambling defence was persistent in their man-marking, if not always completely clean, with March winning a handful of short corners. However, the pace off the line in defending these of Sam Lansdell and Steve Lane hurried the March shooters, seeing the ball either cleared without a shot or pressured into shooting wide of target.
The second half began in similar vein, with South looking to exert pressure and March looking to hit hard and early into their front three. More strong defending from Lane, Lansdell, Jan Brynjolffssen and John Benedikz, with fewer inadvertent feet, saw March mainly restricted to reverse stick efforts from high-up in the D, while South wingers Tim Gass and Mark Reilly began to cause serious concerns down the March flanks. Halfway through the period South were inches away from breaking the deadlock from a short, Andy Lewis working the ball to Tim Waller, whose flick beat the keeper but was expertly knocked down, and then swept away by a March defender on his own goal line.
In the last ten minutes, March began to throw bodies forward in search of the three points they need for their promotion challenge, taking advantage as South's unaccustomed central midfield pairing of Waller and Ali Blake began to tire after a fine performance (centre forward Ali had done a sterling job out of position, see LoM for more details). A number of half chances were flying around the South D, but the commanding presence of Steve Parker between the sticks swept up anything loose, seeing the match ending in an unusual (highly unusual for South 2nds!) 0-0 draw.","Men's 2nds stalemate against March Town 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

South started brightly and could have gone ahead when Doug Leckie flicked a shot across the D into the top corner, only for the effort to be debatably ruled out for dangerous play.
South recovered from this disappointment to take the lead with a fine goal. Centre forward Tony Wiskich made a cross-field run, before driving down the right channel. Having got to the byline, Tony pulled the ball back for strike partner Mark Reilly, arriving on the penalty spot, to sweep home.
Unfortunately, the team who appeared galvanised by this goal was Deeping and they promptly took almost total charge of the game. With South struggling to clear their defensive zone, an equaliser looked inevitable,and it came in very similar fashion to South's goal: a drive down the right, a cross pulled back to a deep lying striker, who swept in.
Following this goal, Deeping continued to press but somewhat against the run of play, good opportunism saw South regain the lead in the dying moments of the half. Good interplay down the right between Tony and Doug produced a cross which Chris Clegg arrived on to sweep goalwards (a pattern was emerging here!). Whereas the previous two shots had been aimed at the far post, Chris went for the near, to wrong-foot the keeper, and was a mite too accurate, his shot striking the woodwork. However, the ball ran free to Tony Wiskich, who lifted it into the net from a tight angle to see South finish the half leading 2-1.
The next goal in the match seemed likely to be decisive, and so it proved. South were pushing to establish a two goal lead when they conceeded a free-hit in the oppositions circle. A quick accurate hit out sprang Deeping for a counter-attack, and good interplay between the Deeping forwards saw the ball eventually worked around keeper Jim Sutcliffe and knocked into the open net. With South somewhat deflated by this, Deeping increased the pressure and soon took the lead for the first time in the match. A break down the left resulted in a good cross, which was knocked home conclusively at the far post by the late arriving right-winger.
South tried to push on in the dying stages and came agonisingly close to equalising from a short. A poor push-out appeared to catch the Deeping defence unawares and with the keeper already lying prone, Stuart Creed manoeuvred himself a great position. However, he failed to get enough purchase on his flick and the keeper shot up an arm to deflect it behind. To be honest, if South had equalised, it would have been a point stolen, as Deeping had looked a strong, fit team, moving the South defence around well and finishing clinically, to fully justify the three points.
The day went from bad to worse for South when the other results came through, as Ely City 3rds picked up their first win for some time, beating Peterborough Athletic 3rds 2-0.

The home midfield engine of Fleck and Massey, were able to gain control and set forwards Wong and Wiskich off on dangerous attacks. This bore fruit as Nick Wong got on to the end of a couple of great crosses to stab the ball in from close range for a brace of early goals.
The whole team was playing aggressive, committed hockey, not giving Spalding the space to come back. Home team substitutions kept Spalding guessing and enabled South to conserve energy. Some had to play in unfamiliar positions, notably Tim Waller (left back) and Mark Reilly (wide mid), but no one looked out of place. Stuart Creed grabbed a third goal just on half time with a long-range bobbler deceiving the keeper. The lead was well deserved but it still needed cool defence, with the Benedikz brothers at the core.
Spalding came back after the interval and got a goal from one of a number of short corners; they were unlucky not to have a penalty soon after, but this didn't deter South. Chris Massey got the final goal from a well-worked short corner interchange with Andy Lewis.
South had to win to give themselves a good chance of staying in 5NW but we were relying on Ely City 3rds to drop points later in the day.

South started with passion and determination and were the superior side throughout the match. It was 2-0 but could have been more and after weathering sustained pressure from St Ives in the second half, South hit back with two further goals before the final whistle.
After the two friendlies leading up to this first league game of the season, South knew that they would have to raise their game if they were to compete for promotion this season. Last week's 5-1 thrashing by Harlow was particularly demoralising as there was little positive to take from the game at all. Stern words were said from captain Chris Baker, though, and the players responded in just the right way in this game.
Accused of slow starts in previous games, this time South were putting pressure on the St Ives defence from the very beginning. A slow back line had great difficulty coping with the speed, directness and sharp passing of the South front line  this week comprising Murray, Garrett and Rowland. The first goal came from Chris Graveling as he collected a side line pass from Rupert Webb on the edge of the opponents' D. With all the St Ives defence marking the forwards, Graveling had all the time in the world to pass the ball calmly into the corner of the net. Rumours of a subsequent chant from the crowd of ""Graveling for striker"" are completely unfounded
South continued to put pressure on the St Ives goal and would have scored more with a bit of luck  two goal line clearances keeping the score sheet respectable after Chris Baker added to Gravelings initial strike.
The end of the half saw St Ives grow in confidence and start to attack with more purpose. It was no surprise in the second half when they came out with much more running and determination. This renewed pressure eventually produced a goal for the home side but it proved to be merely a consolation as South refused to buckle or wilt.
Large gaps in the St Ives defence opened up as the home side pressed for an equaliser and South continued to create the better opportunities. Finally, one of these created a second goal for Chris Baker after good work down the right between Kevin Rowland and Tim Waller.","Men's 1sts beat St Ives 3 ","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

After half time St Ives dominated, getting two further goals, but the home team kept hope alive with two more Greaves efforts, one from distance, blasting through a melee of players, and his third from a deft dummy (ie total mishit), which dribbled into the net past a confused St Ives keeper.

City pulled a goal back early in the second half after a goal mouth scramble in the South D, but equality only lasted a couple of minutes. A quick break from the South midfield up the right and Matt Murray was put through on goal. A clinical finish and South were back in front.

This contrasted with Saffron Walden 6, who have the luxury or using a 7th team as a development team and who are in the process of bringing out an 8th team.
The game started with Saffron Walden having the majority of possession but not being able to close, due to some able goalkeeping by Lino Di Lorenzo and some competent umpiring which disallowed a short corner hit which struck home above the backboard.
South were dangerous on the break and threatened the Saffrron Walden goal a few times. However eventually home pressure paid off and Saffron Walden went one-nil up. South reshuffled at this point, moving Ian Evans to central back, dropping David Bridge to left back and moving George Lilley to midfield.
A change is as good as a rest, and a rejuvenated South now surged forward and into the Saffron Walden D. The resultant goal was a pell-mell affair eventually struck home by John Sharp after a number of previous shots by, I think, inter alios Tristen Knight and James Raikes.
For most of the remainder of the half South held their own, with Phil Le Gouais doing sterling work as sweeper, ably backed up by Ian Evans and Chris Davies, with Lorenzo the Magnificent acting as the ultimate backstop. Saffron Walden did eventually steal a couple more goals, but South were always threatening with some good runs by John, John, James and Tristen.
Mark Jackson, playing his first hockey after a two year break showed elements of his previous panache and George Lilley promised potential with his maiden appearance for the club.

The commitment and determination were excellent across the team and, although we only managed a single goal, we never looked like losing. South made some forced changes to the side, bringing up a number of 2nd team and Vets players in order to cover for various absentees, but these alterations did nothing hinder the progress of the team.
South started brightly and made a number of good attacks throughout the first half, particularly through Kevin Rowland down the right, but were unable to break down the tight Ely defence. Ely defended deep and there was plenty of space in front of their defence but we were finding it difficult to create clear opportunities. One half chance fell to Dan Pippard as he made an excellent run to the top of the D to meet Kevin Rowland's cross but his snap shot on the run didn't trouble the Ely keeper.
The new South defence (Graveling and Benedikz joined by Andy Bleach and Jan Brynjolffssen) were rarely troubled by the Ely forwards and Benedikz's pre-match complaints of never having played centre back before looked unfounded.
The South display was particularly encouraging for the way it built upon previous performances as we made much better use of the width of the pitch, and the defence was spreading the ball about with well, not quite consummate ease, but there was certainly a sense of gay abandon about it at times!
At half time the score was 0-0 but the sun was making the Ely team visibly tired and we knew that, so long as we continued to press forward, the goal should come. Graveling, however, decided to take matters into his own hands (either that or he forgot that we'd changed ends at half time), for early in the second half he was inches away from putting a cross into the Ely goal. Shortly after this, a South short corner ended up on his stick with only a defender on the line but the Ely defence closed down quickly and didn't allow him to turn and shoot.
At the other end of the pitch, Ely had their first real chance of the game. A loose ball out of defence gave the Ely forward an opportunity in the D, but the alert Steve Parker was out of his goal quickly to smother the danger. Shortly after this Ely forced a short corner and the resultant shot from Ely needed to be pushed away by Parker. This was but a brief respite for Ely, though, as Creed and Lewis combined down the South right on a number of occasions but couldn't quite create a goal.
Finally, with only a few minutes left on the clock, we broke the deadlock. Graveling (I guess he still hadn't worked up the energy to jog back into our own half) took the ball into the D, past a couple of Ely defenders and crossed the ball just a couple of metres in front of the Ely goal. As the Ely keeper came out to clear it Rob Garrett was in the right place at the right time to sweep the ball between the keeper's legs and into the centre of the goal (and this time I definitely heard it hit the backboard!).
Afterwards we found out that this was only the second goal that Ely had conceded so far this season, so all in all it was a very satisfactory game.","Men's 1sts beat Ely City 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Cambridge South started positively, applying most of the early pressure, only for a breakaway attack by Spalding to bring the first goal against the run of play.
Cambridge South responded positively, with excellent work from Tom Moy and Wilco Dijkstra in midfield and running by Tristen Knight in attack. South's pressure was rewarded when Tristen equalised with an excellent strike from an acute angle near the touchline.
The match was a close fought affair, with Cambridge South having more possession but Spalding looking dangerous on the break. Such a break brought another goal from Spalding, when a cross from the byline was unfortunately deflected into the South goal off South's keeper. South once more raised their game to level the score, Tristen scoring his second, this time with a fierce low strike from the top of the D through a crowded area, for the teams to go in level at half time [CSHC 2-2 Spalding].
The second half started well for South, with a well worked short corner bringing Tristen's hat trick, and putting South ahead for the first time in the game. The remainder of the second half was as closely fought as the first, with generally superior South possession threatened by the pace and running of Spalding on the break.
As legs tired, credit goes to sweeper Phil Le Gouais, who literally bled in the cause, and Chris Clegg, for untiring running covering his own position and more besides. Unfortunately, a season-opening South victory was prevented when a wickedly undercut Spalding strike flew past the ear of South's keeper, Lino Di Lorenzo.
Overall, a very close contest with never more than goal in it. South can take great credit from the performance, with dedication and good passing throughout the team.

This South team has steadily improved as each week has gone by and today Nomads had no reply to the sharp, fluid passing of South and the intelligent movement in attack. Nomads struggled to create any clear opportunities against the meanest defence in the league.
At the start of the day South and Nomads were joint top of the league, each with three wins out of three. With this in mind it was unsurprising that the start was cagey. The opening fifteen minutes were evenly matched, with neither team creating any clear cut opportunities.
The deadlock was broken on fifteen minutes when Chris 'Durex' Baker struck a free hit from the edge of the D goal-ward and Forrest deflected the ball over the keeper's left leg. This was his third goal of the season and, true to form, the ball barely touched the backboard as it trickled over the line!
The goal proved to be the spark that South needed and a few minutes later South extended their lead. Durex got his first goal of the game, striking the ball in directly from a short corner. Nomads got a goal back through a deflected hit from the edge of the D (showing Forrest how it's done  this one hitting the back of the goal with definite purpose). But Rowland made the score 31 at half time with a wonderful reverse stick sweep into the far corner of the net. Murray made good work down the left, beating a couple of defenders before crossing for Rowland to slot home.
At half time, coach Shaun Park made some suggestions and South altered the formation accordingly, pushing Matt Readman in front of the defence and moving Durex further forward. This proved to be a master stroke in tactics as the second half saw South dominating and scoring at will. At the back, the South defence was spreading the ball left and right with ease  full backs Benedikz and Hay were the starting points of many of the South attacks.
With Reilly and Forrest combining well down the left, and Murray and Creed making good work down the right, large gaps were opening up in front of the Nomads defence. This created many opportunities for the South midfield. Within ten minutes of the start of the second half, Durex had completed his hat trick, on both occasions finding no difficulty in sliding the ball into the gaping hole left between the Nomads keeper's legs.
Midway through the second half, Matt Readman got his first goal of the season (on his first league start). Making another penetrating run deep into the Nomads defence, he slipped the ball to Forrest. Forrest managed to eventually knock the ball goal ward past the keeper and Readman snaffled it in at the near post under pressure from a Nomads defender.
South started to sit back a bit from here, letting Nomads pansy around with the ball for a while. But there was little danger of Nomads scoring with Thorpey in commanding form at the back. Graveling was so confident in his team mates ability that he completely ignored his duties at left back and decided to stroll nonchalantly around the pitch (seems to be something of a habit these days), but even with three against two, it was Thorpey and Readman that came out with the ball.
At the other end Stu 'Killer' Creed had an excellent opportunity at the top of the Nomads D and he took it with great enthusiasm. The ball didn't go very far, but the Nomads defender fell like the proverbial sack of spuds! Fortunately the battle hardened 'Bruiser' Murray was on hand to advise (apparently the victims cheekbones are quite prominent anyway, so the extra swelling was er ""hardly noticeable"". Provided youre more than 100 yds away.)
Ten minutes from the end, Murray set up Durex for his fourth of the game to finish off South's biggest win for, oh, at least thirty-two league games (thats as far back as this reporter knows about).","Men's 1sts smash Cambridge Nomads 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Deeping have been a good side in this division for the past couple of seasons, narrowly missing out on promotion both times, and from the signs on Saturday, they will probably go close again. Whilst South couldn't claim to be their equals from this match, Deeping deserving the victory, our performance was good and the match at least felt closer than recent games between the two sides.
South started the match quite slowly, trying to bed in the three late call-ups from the 3rd team, Wilco Dijkstra, Neil Sneade and James Raikes, who were rotating in support of Suk Pannu as part of South's 3 man midfield. Also finding his feet in the first fifteen minutes was left winger Finn Johnson, who initially looked rusty playing his first game for a month, but got back into the swing as the match progressed.
Having survived a difficult opening quarter-hour without damage, South were annoyed to then fall behind to a goal tinged with controversy. A quick Deeping attack had seen South's defence all at sea, and a forward free in our D. His shot hit a South foot, and ballooned up in the air, but was heading wide. However, the Deeping centre-forward reacted to the ball to knock it home. South protested that he had knocked it home in a dangerous fashion, by swinging at an aerial ball. The Umpires consulted and decided the decisive touch had been a legal deflection, not a swing, so the goal stood. South quickly put their disappointment at this behind them, and were soon back level.
A Deeping short-corner routine was broken down by Jan Brynjolffssen, who fed the ball on to Tom Gowing. Tom drove it to the Deeping twnety-five, where he won a free hit for a foot. With Deeping's midfield struggling to get back up the pitch to help their defence, Suk Pannu took an early, hard free hit. Tom and a defender got half a touch on it and Jan, having stayed up with the initial attack, and now hanging around unmarked near the right post, swept the loose ball home.
South nearly conceded straight from the restart, with low concentration allowing Deeping to cut through on keeper Lino Di Lorenzo, who was out fast enough to narrow the angle and force the forward to shoot wide. This was the final serious action of the first half.
South's half-time teamtalk concentrated on playing with a bit more drive, coming to receive balls, not waiting for them to reach you, and committing hard to our tackles. Unfortunately, Deeping's teamtalk appeared to centre on similar ""Make this ours"" themes, and they started the second-half in dominant fashion. South spent ten minutes barely able to clear the halfway line and eventually the pressure told, when Deeping's dangerous centre-forward was too sharp for his markers, reacting quickest to a sideline hit to turn home.
South were still in the game at this point, but it didn't last for long. A Deeping short corner, won after a goalmouth scramble, was flicked low and hard, beating Lino for pace: 3-1.
South now had to press forward to get anything form the game, although this left them exposed in defence. With too many players looking to dribble it all the way through themselves, the ball was being lost in tackles and Deeping were showing South how it should be done, moving the ball on fast, hard, and, mostly importantly, instantly on receiving it. One such piece of counter-attacking produced three players through with just Mark Jackson and Lino to beat, which they did by inter-passing the ball to walk it home.
The positives from South's point of view from this game were the energy and commitment all the players showed throughout, with some nice skill thrown in as well at times. This was exemplified when South got the final goal of the game. Samin Ishtiaq reacted sharply to a poor Deeping sixteen yard hit, stole the ball off his opponent and won a free-hit for obstruction. Suk once again drove it in cleanly for Tom Gowing, who had found a spot unmarked just wide of the right post, to deflect home. Post match talk concentrated on using the ball better in attacking situations and that this could mean (often does mean) turning around and playing the ball backwards when confronted by a defender. Not dribbling it into him, and losing it
South's man of the match was clearly Suk Pannu for a strong midfield performance, featuring nice distribution, good tackling and tracking back, and of course assists on both the goals.","Men's 2nds lose to Market Deeping 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

This they did to a man as Cambridge South ground out their fifth straight league win over bottom of the table March 3rds.
South started poorly with a formation that left them badly exposed at the back, a deep and roaming March centre forward pulling South central defender Jim Thorpe out of his favourite pivotal position. Chris Graveling was enjoying more freedom to push forward than usual but the closest he got was a swing and a miss on the top of the D. Missed, in fact, with such vigour that he ended up on his back, much to the mirth of twenty-one other players and fifteen or twenty travelling supporters.
South were always looking dangerous going forwards with new player Lukas Snetler linking well with Messrs Garrett, Waller and Carey. However, it wasn't until Mark Jackson found some space on the left wing and was able to deliver a superb cross into the waiting right wing that the on-form Kevin Keith Rowland was able to bury an almost unbelievable reverse stick first time strike. 1-0 at the break.
The restart saw South revert to their more usual defensive strategy and the extra man at the back allowed Steve Lane and John Benedikz space to move forward and link well with the wingers. March persisted with the long ball to the centre forward approach, which offered little return as the defence generally snuffed out the danger with ease. Once the umpires had been sufficiently softened up by just the right amount of heckling, they eventually saw red and bought out the yellow for a luckless March player guilty of up-ending Chris Graveling, Tana Umaga style.
This bought South some breathing space and at the other end, skipper for the day Rob Garret was lucky enough to be blessed by a Peter Carey special as the ""mad Irishman"" danced around the March defence to deliver an inch perfect pass to the predatory centre forward to slot home with apparent ease.
Throughout the game the South goalie was keeping the visitors in the match, with a total shut out. Numerous short corners were saved and scrambled March efforts in the D were thwarted with all the control you would expect from the veteran keeper. A good solid performance all round and three points well earned.","Men's 1sts beat March Town 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Flowing attacking moves were rewarded when Tom Gowing placed the ball into the top of the net from a pinpoint Andy Lewis cross soon after the start. Skipper John Greaves extended the lead soon after as he pounced on a rebound off the goalpost to drive the ball past the flailing keeper with a reverse stick effort.
Although Long Sutton came back just before half time with a well worked move, the home defence otherwise stood firm with Andy Bleach coolly sweeping the ball away from the danger area repeatedly and his fellow defenders snuffing out attacks bravely.
After half time South were on the defensive and conceded many short corners but few shots were allowed. Tom Moy made the game safe with a corker of a shot from long range near the end after Chris Clegg had almost managed to remove his ear by crashing into a Long Sutton forward.
South themselves had numerous efforts from attacking breaks, with Greaves, Finn Johnson, and Andy Lewis all being unlucky. Some were saved on the line and others went narrowly wide. The Long Sutton keeper had to play excellently to keep the score down.
Special mention must be made of Stuart Creed, turning out for the team fresh from attending to his newly extended family. Such dedication. The whole team played well for a well deserved victory to keep South well in mid-table.","Men's 2nds beat Long Sutton 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

The first half had seen South totally dominant, with the ball barely leaving the Ely half. An early lead was secured when Tristen Knight slammed home a trademark short corner finish. After that chances were either made and missed, or South forwards were getting in each other's way. One smart move down the right involving James Raikes and Tristen came close to extending the lead, but the ball flashed just wide.
The 2nd half began with South employing a new plan of spreading the play. Unfortunately, the major incident in the game took place five minutes into the half, when an Ely head was in collision with a swinging South stick. The wound was obviously deep and an ambulance had to be called to attend.
After a fifteen minute hiatus, and following a discussion between the captains, the game was resumed. However, the felled gentleman had been one of the adults in the Ely side, and his loss badly affected their ability to clear their lines. With South now almost permanently camped in the Ely twenty-five, a second strike from Tristen soon made it 2-0 and further goals were added by George Lilley (his first for the club), John Sharp, Tom Smith (again, a debut goal, from a hard shot) and David Bridge.

Within the first five minutes South were 1-0 up after Rob Garrett harried the Bourne defence into a mistake and slotted home the loose ball.
A disorganised Bourne team couldn't cope with the movement of the South midfield and forwards and South created numerous chances throughout the half. Matt Murray scored two excellent goals and Chris Baker was also on the score sheet before half-time, for his eighth goal in five league appearances.

The away team were unlucky not to score more, and even had a penalty saved shortly after.
In the second half Alford responded, but tight defending, with John Benedikz at sweeper particularly dominant, kept them out. Mark Jackson and Andy Kennedy in midfield were constantly harrying the opposition, and Chris Clegg again appeared to be filling in at least three positions all at the same time due to his huge energy. Although the game ended with play mostly in the South half, few chances were allowed, and the more dangerous moves were at the Alford end.

Due to the 3rds supplementing several players to the firsts and seconds, the final team was formed just an hour before the match. Despite this, South started strongly and immediately took the game to St Ives. The midfielders got the ball through and seasonal debutant forwards James Bridge and Jon Price were able to outpace the St Ives defenders.
It wasn't long before South's efforts paid off and still energetic double-up Rob Garett scored. Although St Ives tried hard to get back, our defence led by sweeper Andy Passmore and Steven Lane proved strong, and they found it easy to get the ball out via John Sharp and Phil Le Gouais.
Not long after, Rob wrongfooted the keeper by running across the backline and firing a direct shot at goal at a difficult angle rather than back to the top of the D. Although a St Ives defender stopped the ball with his foot on the line by lack of alternative options, a penalty goal was awarded. Later in the first half St Ives scored a lucky goal after a scramble in our D, resulting in a ball rolling slowly into our goal.
In the second half South continued to be strong with many scoring opportunities, some hard hits passing only inches past the post. It was only a matter of time before South scored two more goals, with our Jon Price (usually the keeper, making a rare foray outfield) and midfielder Wilco Dijkstra scoring.
St Ives, desperate to win and reinvigorated by two substitutes, stepped up a gear and succeeded in getting many short corners awarded despite the efforts of our defence and midfielders David Bridge and John Somerville. However South's defence proved impenetrable with keeper Tim Poole stopping various shots in the last fifteen minutes.
South, getting tired without subs, still managed to break free several times and were dangerous in the opposition's D, but didn't increase their lead. And so the final score was 4-1 for Cambridge South, a well-deserved victory, resulting in South displacing St Ives from the second position in the league.

Wisbech were better organised, better motivated and, crucially, more determined. Wisbech chased down all loose balls and any 50-50 was quickly turned into a 70-30 in their favour. In this dark, desolate and despondent fenland, South resembled the walking dead that ought to live in this part of the world.
South were on the back foot for the majority of the first half, struggling to find a way out of defence. The usually sure footed South rear-guard found it difficult to cope with the Wisbech attack, particularly when they found that our left side was rather less robust than is normally the case. With Benedikz struggling with illness and Jackson and Gowing, standing in for 1st team absentees, struggling to find their feet, the South left side had ""welcome to our goal"" written all over it. On the other side of the pitch, the ever assured Bleachy was faring better, snuffing out danger with the help of Snetler at right mid. But the fabled ""diamond"" midfield was all too transparent.
Mid way through the half Wisbech made good on their attacking promise, slotting home a loose ball to make it 1-0. They added another before half time after a bit of a scramble in the South D. On the few occasions that South found the opposite half of the pitch there was much running and effort but little end product. Baker slipped a delicate ball through for Rowland to run on goal but the Wisbech keeper was out quickly to smother the danger. Forrest lived up to his nickname with some quick bursts all over the place, but without really threatening anything.
But Baker wasnt made captain for just any old reason. Nope, he was specially selected for his key motivational skills, man management ability and excellent track record at the cutting edge of hockey. Oh, and he was also the only person available to do the job. Surveying his repertoire of team talks, he decided to go with the hair drier treatment this time. It wasn't pretty, but it did the trick.
In the second half South came out, well, perhaps not fighting as such, but certainly ready for a bit of handbags. Matching the Wisbech effort, they managed to nullify their attacks and start to gain a foothold in the game. The midfield were more committed, which gave Thorpe, Bleach and Benedikz some much needed protection. This gave Readman time and space in front of the defence. And behind the defence, and anywhere else on the pitch he deigned to go.
Some good movement and passing from South soon opened up the Wisbech defence and gave Baker a clear sight of goal. Usually so deadly in the D, this time he trod on the ball and the opportunity was gone. South continued to press and forced a succession of short corners but they couldn't capitalise on them, only once forcing a clearance on the line from the defence. Another good attacking move put Gowing through but the ball just ran away from him. With the clock ticking down the South defence decided to try to show the attackers how it was done. First up was Thorpey, exchanging quick passes with Forrest down the centre of the pitch but unfortunately no goal. Next up the direct dribbling of Readman, which was fortunately more productive. Drawing defenders out of position with his run, he slipped a slide rule pass into the path of Forrest who dispatched the ball into the corner of the net past the despairing dive of the onrushing keeper.
2-1 down, ten minutes to go and South could smell blood. Wisbech were being pushed back and were making mistakes. Finally, some determination from South and the final push gave them the barely-deserved draw. Readman again coming forward and causing problems for Wisbech. A neat passing move in the midfield involving most of the team, a classic South build up of patience and probing. The final ball exquisitely into the path of Forrest who didn't disappoint with a neat finish under the Wisbech keeper.

The home team played well from the start, with varied attacking moves using the width of the pitch and Stuart Creed driving forward from central midfield. The opening goal came from the old Greaves-Lewis short corner routine, as Andy Lewis shot in unstoppably from the edge of the D. Peterborough Athletic responded towards half time and scrambled an equaliser through a goalmouth melee.
South, as is increasingly the case, refused to give in, and retook the lead as Creed battled through some hairy tackles and, instead of waiting for the foul, just fought his way towards goal and after a couple of efforts, shot from close in.
The dynamic(ish) duo struck again as Lewis once more connected with a Greaves short corner to double the lead, as South kept up their attacking approach. Peterborough then came back strongly, getting their second goal from a clean short corner routine. They camped in the home twenty-five for most of the last ten minutes, but the reshaped defence stood firm and South held out for victory.

Saints, who had made the trip with only ten men, took the lead in the opening couple of minutes when a ball ricocheted around the South D and was bundled home. Soon after this, one of the Away ten injured his hamstring, seriously restricting his mobility, and this prompted a sensible decision of ""What we have, we hold."" South plugged away at the now deep lying St Neots team but couldn't force their way through the crowd and the teams turned around with Saints still 1-0 up.
South made a half-time switch to a 3-4-3 formation to try and drag defenders wide and out of the D. However, a tendency to attack up the middle instead saw most attacks fizzle out before reaching the away keeper.
Finally, with less than five minutes remaining, some wing play created an equaliser. A ball was crossed from the left wing, skipper Wilco Dijkstra shot at goal, and forward Ian Evans added a deflection just in front of the keeper, giving him little chance. In the final frantic two minutes, Evans had a chance to win it, a ball deflecting to him in the D, but he pulled his shot wide from a narrow angle.","Men's 3rds draw with St Neots 5","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Turning up fully eighty minutes before push-back is unheard of in this reporter's time at the club, but even Muzza was present and correct at 10.30 for Cheggers's pre-match tactics and coaching session.
Yes, you'd better believe it  there were chairs and even a white board and for over half an hour the nuances of the new hockey formation were espoused to the hockey faithful. Changing to a 4-1-2-1-2 formation (or 'the diamond' as it's better known), Cheggers was confident that goals would be easier to come by whilst also providing more cover for the defence.
As push-back approached, many of the opposition were still missing and so the start of the game was delayed by fifteen minutes. As more of their players trickled in the general feeling was that these young whippersnappers (for their average age appeared to be about half ours) should be shown er the tougher side of hockey, shall we say. This was particularly taken to heart by Wallace, who was lucky to stay on the pitch near the end of the game after another spectacular rugby tackle, sorry, I mean graceful and precise snatching of the ball that coincidentally happened to leave a couple of the opposition laid out on the floor.
When the game did get under way, Long Sutton were still without a couple of players and South took advantage in the most dramatic fashion by scoring within thirteen seconds of the pushback. Surely the fastest goal in South history? Snetler to Thorogood, a quick pass to Baker who drifts into the Long Sutton half. The pass to Forrest is flicked into the path of Snetler who advances into the D and sweeps the ball past the oncoming keeper. A new formation that's already paying dividends!
The pre-match tactics, and change in formation, were proven to be an excellent decision as South played the first half with focus, determination, control and an excellent work rate. South passed frequently across the back four to spread the play and were rarely unable to get the ball out from sixteen yard hits. Thorogood provided much-needed protection in front of the defence and was a useful outlet to the midfield. The freedom this afforded Cheggers, playing just behind the front two, caused constant problems for the Long Sutton defence, who struggled all game to cope with the pace of Forrest and Snetler up front. The second goal came after good work from Cheggers in the D, and his goal-ward push was converted by Muzza, who'd ghosted in at the far-post.
South continued to fashion clear-cut chances throughout the half as full-backs Webb and 'Psycho' Benedikz provided outlets up to the midfield and wings. Snetler was unlucky not to add to his tally when through on goal but the Sutton keeper was out quickly to make the save. The tenacious and hard-working Finn almost found the back of the net after a long corner was turned across the D by Forrest but the ball was just in front of his reaching stick. The third goal did arrive in the end, when an advancing Thorpey found Forrest on the half way line who ran goal-ward, rounded the keeper and slotted home.
In the second half South were reinforced by the insertion of Morgan the Organ at right back, which pushed Webb up to right mid. With a 3-0 lead the home side were content to sit back and absorb the Long Sutton pressure, and despite a succession of short corners the away team never looked like scoring. Graveling and Thorpe were superb at the back, organising and orchestrating the marking. Keeper Jon Price did good work and stopped a number of hurried Sutton shots.
But this was a first rate defensive display from the whole team and Tristen and Webb in the middle of the park were tirelessly tackling and tracking back  even Cheggers was seen back in the home 22! Snetler scampered about on the half way line and forced the visitors to hurry all their passes. Defending from the front always makes things easier. South were able to create a few chances as Long Sutton left gaps at the back, the best one coming from a right wing Forrest cross to Tristen that was dealt with by a last-minute tackle from a Sutton defender, but a fourth goal didn't look likely.
In the end, an excellent team performance from South  if we can continue to play like that this league will pose little difficulty for us.

After sweeping aside the Mens Second XI 4-0 last week, confidence was high but Harlow proved to be a sterner test and after 45 minutes the home side were 3-0 down. But with the stands starting to fill, the burgeoning home support spurred South to an unlikely comeback that ended with the score 4 goals apiece.
As is customary at this stage of the season, there were a number of changes from the team that played in the previous match. With regular captain Cheggers still absent (no one seems to know where or, perhaps more importantly, who with) the returning vice-captain Forrest took up the reigns for the day. With Lukas also back in the team we were back to our traditional front-line. Lino returned in goal (despite conceding 4 the previous week...), and Chris Curly Massey was also back  this time on a more permanent basis after his studying in Durham came to an end.
South started the match intending to make it fortress Leys and their purposeful play brought them the majority of the possession. Eliot was covering almost every inch of the pitch and was an important force at both ends of the field. Flash was distributing balls well from left mid, and Curly was the often much-needed calming influence in the middle of the park. A changed back-line of Morgan The Organ, Graveling, Chopper and Psycho gelled together well and were easily halting the Harlow advances. Unfortunately, at the other end of the pitch our final ball was often slightly off, and we were unable to capitalise on our possession. Half-chances fell to Lukas, Eliot and Forrest but none could be converted. And almost inevitably, as we pushed forward, Harlow scored a break away goal that left Lino with a 2 on 1 situation. Soon after, the away side doubled their lead and although we pressed forward we were unable to find a way back into the game.
We started the second half with renewed vigour but soon found ourselves 3 down. This served only to spark the home side in to life as they (finally) worked out where the goal was. The first goal came from the instrumental Eliot (man of the match in the post-match vote), sweeping home a cross from Forrest. Tim Waller scored the second, pushing the ball through the keepers legs from a few yards out. Forrest then grabbed the equaliser when a Lukas cross flicked off his stick, clipped a defenders stick, bounced off the keeper and bobbled over the line. Hey, they all count. With the hard work done, South fatally stepped off the gas and allowed Harlow back in the game and suddenly it was 4-3 down with less than 10 minutes to play. Fortunately man of the moment Tim Waller was on hand again to clinically steer home his second of the game to ensure the spoils were shared.
The final moments of the game were open and frenetic as both sides attempted to take advantage of some early-season tiredness in the defenders legs but despite being put through by the courteous Flash, Harlow were unable to grab a winner.
Flash redeemed himself post-match by steering the opposition to the wrong pub and thus ensuring that we had all the food to ourselves  thanks Flash! [Note: if anyone from Harlow is reading this, were sorry for the misunderstanding that must have taken place. We gave instructions for the Hat & Feathers pub, but the Red Bull is the first pub you come to on Barton Road and I guess someone wanted his beer a little bit sooner than that].
Finally, a mention to John Benedikz, aka Psycho, aka first team bitch. He won the inaugural Gimp of the Day award for the pre-match shirt mix-up.","Men's 1sts draw with Harlow Town 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

This 12 included 6 players whose preferred position was centre-forward (at least as far as your correspondent was aware), so how Kev arranged us into his preferred 4-4-2 was going to be an interesting affair. In fact, to get the team properly organised, a white board was produced on the sidelines with formations and players names on it (ooh, professional!). As goalkeeper Jane found out, its not wise to rub out and replace how the captain has chosen to (mis)spell your name.
From the opening whistle South gained the upper hand. Good running into the corners from the front pair of Simon and Rob was giving options for a midfield that was working hard to spread the ball wide. Chances were created from a number of sweeping moves as opposition defenders were bypassed with passing triangles, instead of players risking trying to beat their man and getting mugged.
At the other end, the defence was being well organised by Jack Chalk at sweeper. Only a handful of shots, created by individual skill from the opposition rather than slack marking, went in on Janes goal in the opening period.
Inside the last five minutes of the half, South took a deserved lead. Kev, picking up the scraps of a previous attack, found midfield partner James in space in the right channel. He was able to advance to the edge of the circle unmolested and fire a shot at the far post (have we been listening in training or something?). There it was met be a defender and the keeper, along with Simon, the ball ricocheting into the net with Simon claiming the score based on the faintest of touches.
The second half opened with a similar pattern of South probing, especially through dynamic right midfielder Matt. Harlow were struggling to clear their lines, and conceding shorts, which lead to a doubling of the lead when Kev converted one with a clean shot into an unguarded corner of the net. South kept the press up, with centre-forward Rob adding a third, on the rebound, on the reverse sweep, ending up on his arse as the ball hit the backboard. Poetry. With that, the game was pretty well up.
Harlow kept plugging away, and finished the match with some pressure on the South goal, as a bit of complacency crept into visitors marking. The closest they came to a consolation was a shot from a short that was heading for the far corner until Jane padded it clear.
The whole team played well. The only slight quibble would be the gap that was allowed to open between midfield and forwards in the last ten minutes of each half. With fitness, that one will hopefully be resolved. A very encouraging start to the season.

CSouth scored first as man of the match Steve Fleck shot powerfully at the outstanding (ex-first team) Royston keeper, only for the lurking John Greaves to get the slightest deflection to turn the ball in to the net.
Royston came back strongly after half time with two goals, outmuscling the defence, giving new keeper Shahbaz Ali no chance. Shahbaz was otherwise calm and solid in spite of a sprained wrist, and made a number of essential saves - not as many as the Royston keeper who saved repeatedly form Greaves, Fleck, Barton and Ta. CSouth grabbed the equaliser after a goalmouth scramble from Rob Barton, but this wasn't enough, and Royston scored twice in the final minutes.
Notable performances came from the lively Steve McCulloch in midfield, and James Bridge at sweeper - who got a bloody face from an accidental clash for his efforts - and CSouth had their moments, but overall Royston showed better discipline and coherence as a team and were worthy winners.

The visitors had turned up with only ten men due to late dropouts, so with South having 12 available, Paul South, as starting sub, became an honorary aeronautical engineer for the afternoon. Even then, MDBA began with only 10 as one of their remaining players was caught up in the heavy weekend traffic and didnt make it until midway through the first period. With the disruption in the visiting teams ranks caused by all this, it was perhaps little surprise that South ran them ragged in the opening period. A high press kept the ball trapped in the attacking third for long periods, with the 2nds passing again looking superior to last season in picking holes in the defensive line.
South soon opened the scoring; Simon goal thief Ta was at it again, adding a little deflection to strike partner Robs shot from high in the circle. Typical Simon goal, stealing in front of a keeper on his line. It might have gone in without the touch, but Simon made certain. Our second was a direct result of the continuing pressure, as play broke down in the MDBA circle, only for the ball to break to Gareth who swept home on the reverse, and whooped a typical war cry to celebrate. South scored the game killer before the break, and it was the best of the lot; Andy took a free from the left line, finding a great crossfield pass into Matts path as he burst in from his right wing position. Matt won the battle for the ball with Paul (playing for the oppo remember), to be on the penalty spot, ball at his feet. From there, a beautifully dug out reverse stick flick went high into the corner of the net.
The talk at half-time was about playing good hockey, and trying to put into practice the theories and tactics we train on (more on that latter). The second stanza was to prove a more even affair as legs tired under the 25-degree sun. The play was now swinging end to end (i.e. both midfields were blowing a bit), with one particularly rewarding outlet for the hosts coming from centre-back Dave M feeding right winger Matt. Such play, via right-back Jan, had Matt and sweeper Jack exchanging passes in the best move of the match, only for the keeper to foil Robs final shot.
Whilst that attack failed, attacks down the right flank brought Souths final two goals of the game, first Dave M driving upfield and feeding Simon, who dribble round the front of the defence to work himself a gap for a reverse stick flick across the keeper into the far corner and then another break from Matt finding Rob in the circle; the busy visitors keeper stopped Robs shot only to see the ball break free for Simon to tap in his hattrick goal.
Back to tactics. As part of the new commitment to letting the ball do the work, there was an emphasis at halftime on using the back four to switch the ball from one flank to the other. A couple of opportunities to do this had been noticeably passed up in the first half with balls going back to the line they had started out on, into crowds of players. But then someone (see the Lemon of the Match award for likely suspects) had to try and take it too far, didnt they? A sideline hit in Souths own 25 was hit square to centre-back Dave M. Fine if he had been in twenty yards of space, instead of standing with an opposition player within touching distance of him. A graveyard pass was the apt description of it latter. Dave tried his best, but it broke free for an MDBA player to shot past an utterly exposed Jon (who hadnt conceded since December 06, so was not best pleased by such defensive suicide).
However, that was but a little black spot on an otherwise bright sun. Once again the Seconds controlled a match against opposition they have had tough battles with in previous meetings. Chances were created, goals were scored, new player to the club Dave Bartram made his debut at right-back and looked the part. We face a tricky final friendly at Kettering 2s, who have always been a decent team, which will provide another excellent marker of where the side are before the league gets underway on the 29th.","Men's 2nds beat MBDA 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

But this was as good as it got for the home side, as Kettering gradually got into the game and scored twice before the break.

The pace of the South front line had caused problems for Kettering in the first half and opportunities fell to Forrest, new boy Mark Taylor and Finn Johnson, but they weren't able to put the ball in the back of the net. Kettering made them pay for this profligacy in ruthless fashion; carving open the South defence 3 more times in the second half.

With 14 players turning up on the day, it was unsurprising that Cambridge showed a lack of fluidity at times. Swapping players on and off the field was useful for getting players back into the game after the summer lay-off, but it put a strain on the cohesion that we're used to seeing in this side. And with Kettering having their own coach on the sidelines to adjust their tactics and organise the substitutions, it was no surprise that they played with structure and great organisation.

In the end, South were unable to cope with the movement and passing of Kettering and will be disappointed to concede so many goals with only 1 in reply. Next week the league season begins and they will need to show a marked improvement if Captain Chris Baker's vision of promotion is to be fulfilled (or even threatened).","Men's 1sts lose to Kettering 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

The home team found space easily, especially on the wings, with MoM Tim Waller, and Paul South enjoying the freedom to roam upfield. The first goal came from Steve Fleck with a master blast from the top of the D after working space for himself. Skipper John Greaves followed this with a long-range curve ball that deceived the keeper, who obviously thought it was going wide like most of the centre forward's other efforts.

Steve Fleck grabbed another shortly before half time in a similar manner to his first, with another spectacular tonk from distance.

At times CSouth had too much time and space and were tempted to dribble into trouble, but this was corrected, and much good interpassing resulted in a flood of chances, many saved by the Ely keeper, who was their best player. He was not good enough to prevent Tim Waller getting a brace of goals, both by drifting in from the right and being picked out by good passes, before whacking the ball confidently into goal.

Eventually we saw the fearsome sights of rock solid backs Jim Thorpe, Rob Barton, and Ky Ho bounding up field to join in the fun.

The loyal band of fans present were able to enjoy some open hockey, good goals and glaring misses against an Ely team who had good skills, but lacked the speed of thought, enthusiasm, and (relative) pace of the CSouth side.

South werent helped by a degree of disruption in their team planning. First issue was a 30 minute wait after the scheduled meet time for the last player to appear. But hey, why should the captain get there for the time he arranged ;-) Its quite possible that the delay in James arrival was due to an unwanted phone call from the second team up in Kettering; their keeper Jon was meant to be doubling-up between the two matches, but he had got injured playing 2s and was now unfit, leaving an unsuccessful late search for a replacement. With an outfield player having also dropped out late, the 13 originally selected for the game was now pared to a bare 11, with volunteer/short straw drawer Ian G going between the sticks.

Things didnt get easier once we arrived at Bedford. Despite setting out from Cambridge a good hour and a half before push-back, come 3pm only 7 players were on the field. Joe, who was travelling up from London, had been caught up in the football traffic around Arsenals ground, and James B and the Ali brothers had stopped for petrol (how does that take half-an-hour?!?). Bedford seemed relaxed and getting the match going, their players drifting pitchwards with no great rush, so we could delay until 10 South players were there to start, with Joe running on to the pitch after five minutes.

With all this disruption, its little surprise that the South side was disorganised in the opening fifteen minutes, as James had had no chance for a proper teamtalk or to explain to players where they should now play following the loss of two people. Bedford held South in a press, and it need some good keeping by Ian to keep them out. One goal did come as a player was allowed to turn and shoot six yards out. South showed signs of life in attack as they settled down, Joe, James B and James R were combining well, keeping Bedford on their toes, with the team turning around only one in arrears.

The opening stanza of the second period was likely to decide the game, and unfortunately for South their fitness and organisation collapsed. Four goals were added in little more than ten minutes, shots raining on Ian from all angles. Some were soft, like the second were a ball was stolen of a defender in our own 25, worked to an utterly unmarked forward in the circle, who had loads of time to get really close and hammer in. Others were good Bedford play, like the fourth which was a deflection in off the bar from a ball fired in from outside the circle.

Following the collapse, a fightback of sorts. Or at least the remainder of the match saw more determined play, marking in defence, chasing in midfield and some action up front. Some short corners were forced, and the Bedford keeper was giving something to do after an extremely quiet twenty minutes, but no consolation score was forthcoming.

Despite the final score, there were positives to take from the game in the performances of Joe and James B, and the knowledge that Bedford will probably be the strongest side South 4ths are going to face all campaign and we could compete with them for spells.","Men's 4ths lose to Bedford Town 5","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Cambridge South played well for much of the game, but paid the price of some sloppy play in the first 20 minutes of the encounter. Bourne started much the brighter, and their confident passing looked to unsettle the away side and within 20 minutes they side were 2-0 up - capitalising on a defensive mistake and getting a second from a short corner.
Cambridge pulled one back before half-time through captain Chris Baker and put Bourne under continued pressure in the second half but couldn't force the breakthrough, despite gaining a number of short corners. Man of the Match Russell Johnson, playing at right midfield, was particularly effective at unsettling the home defence but the equalising goal wouldn't come. And 10 minutes from the end Bourne effectively sealed the win with a break-away goal that left goal keeper Lino Di Lorenzo with no chance.
Captain Chris Baker was pleased with the way that Cambridge responded to the early set-back, but was concerned at their slow start to the game, saying ""We are notoriously slow starters and paid the price here. On the balance of play for the whole game a draw would have been a fair result.""

However the away team made the best possible start as Steve Fleck pounced onto a Suk Pannu long corner after about 34 seconds to take the lead. Wisbsch equalised soon after, from a routine short corner move which found a forward in space, who gave the keeper Shahbaz Ali no chance, and then took the lead with a classy wing move, but with the game continuing in an open fashion CSouth were able to use Suk Pannu and James Raikes on their own wings to good effect, with the ever lively Andy Lewis causing havoc in the home defence whenever he got the ball. It was a Lewis shot that rebounded off the post to give the lurking skipper John Greaves a simple chance from 1 yard out to equalise.
Still there was more, as just before half time each side got a further goal. Steve Fleck showed more of his wizadry, dribbling into the D and passing to Paul South, who made no mistake to make it 3 - 2, then Wisbech equalised again with a deflection off a defender wrong footing the keeper. This was unfortunate for the CSouth defence, who were mainly solid, sticking well to their marking, with centre back Gareth Hebbron constantly turning defence into attack.
The second half was little different, although Wisbech took the lead for the first time with a long range effort through a crowded D. CSouth equalised as Paul South bagged his second by prodding a Steve Fleck shot into the net as the keeper tried to save. A John Greaves blast from one of many penetrating Suk Pannu free hits was enough to retake the lead, and the game was put beyond Wisbech's reach with a Rob Barton reverse stick special near the final whistle making it 6 - 4.
Overall a great result for CSouth against one of the better teams in this division. The challenges of early season availability and unfamiliar players and positions were in this case outweighed by good passing, use of space, and assertive attacking play, building from midfield.

Spalding 4ths had come into the game with the following record, champions of 7NW in 2005-06, only relegated on the final day from 6NW in 2006-07. So this was a really fine win
Opening day had brought with it its usual problems with convincing players away from their summer Saturday activities. Only a day before the game, South were on ~9, with double-ups looking like they would be needed to be used to fulfil the game. Re-arrangements of domestic/child care issues had eventually provided 11, and then when the Mens 2nds opposition cancelled their game, some quick re-jigging of Umpiring assignments provided two subs. Even with all these unearthed resources, 4th team skipper James Raikes was still needed by the 3rds to make sure they had 11 to start their game, and with vice-captain John Sharp unavailable, it was left to Jan Brynjolffssen to lead the team on the field. Before leaving to play 3rds, James was on the touchline for a good proportion of the match, from where he directed his men and gave encouragement in the style of a WWI General, i.e. a nice safe distance from the trenches!
South had opened the game looking the more cohesive of the two sides, and soon took the lead. Rupert Espley, making his debut for the club, had began the match at left-wing. However for the goal he popped up on the right, taking a pass from another debutant Shahzad Ali, driving to the byline and pulling a ball sharply back for Jan, arriving late in the right-channel from his central-midfield position (no, really, that is where James had put me!). Jan flicked off an instant shot on receiving the ball, and watched in delight (and some surprise) as it flashed inch perfectly into the far corner of the net. You could have got good odds on Jan as the first South male to score a competitive goal this campaign, what with a career strike rate of below a goal per season (OK, enough already, but I enjoyed it!)
The match then settled into an evenly contested affair. South were having more of the territory and possession, and making the better chances, but each of these measures was probably only marginally in their favour. Souths starting back four had contained two more club debutants, Rich Bowman and George Wych, alongside more seasoned campaigners Matt Kern and Ky Ho. They were combining well to frustrate the young opposition forwards, with some solid tackling.
After a period of scoreline equilibrium, the last ten minutes of the first half produced a flurry of goals. South doubled their advantage when Tim Clapp made a coruscating run down the right flank. He reached the circle, and put a dangerous ball across the face of goal, which Rupert turned home on the stretch. Spalding responded by showing they also knew how to exploit the right-flank, a neat run outflanking the defence, with the ball pulled back and then swept goalwards, going through a ruck of players to leave South keeper Jon Price unsighted. Almost from the push-back, South restored their two goal cushion. George, at left-back, made a couple of impressive jab tackles to drive thirty yards up his touchline. He shifted the ball infield to Joe Williamson, who picked out that club chairman Kevin Pride (playing at centre-forward, James really is the master of tactical innovation!) had moved off his man and was clean through. Kevs shot seemed to be heading just wide, until the Spalding keeper caught the ball with his heel, dragging it inside the post. Kev then doubled his tally with a more trademark goal, from a short. His first shot had been blocked, with Kev winning the loose ball and knocking it square to Jan. Jan considered a shot, saw the defender was committed to blocking that, so rolled a return square pass to Kev that gave him the space for a first time strike into the net.
With that, the teams turned around. Spalding came out fighting, still believing they could win. South were having trouble keeping the ball in forward areas, and with the side seemingly inviting pressure, it was perhaps inevitable that a string of shorts would be given away. One of these had produced an almighty goalmouth scramble, with only the tigerish play from the defenders on the line stopping it being forced home. But it was only a matter of time, and finally after approximately five shorts against in two minutes, a loose ball found its way onto the stick of an unmarked striker, five yards out, who swept home.
With the lead down to only two, the next goal in the match was going to be the defining one, and Spalding must have thought they had fashioned it with fifteen minutes left, when they unpicked the South rearguard with some quick interpassing. The move finished with their centre-forward sweeping goalwards from the penalty spot, which produced an outstanding, match-winning, diving save from Jon, not only blocking the shot, but also turning the ball away from the danger area and out for a long corner. As time ticked down, Spalding were throwing men forward, which required the South midfield to chase back hard to cover, an attitude that David Bridge exemplified with three lung-busting fifty yard chases of a player half his age, all within five minutes.
South exploited the defensive gaps that had necessarily been left by their visitors with five minutes to go. A quick counter saw the ball worked into the circle, with Tom Rosselli sweeping home neatly for Souths fifth. The importance of this score was obvious within thirty seconds, as a ricochet in the South circle finally dropped for Spalding, and they had brought it back to 5-3. But with less than five minutes to play, South were able to see out time comfortably for the points.
Stand-in skipper Jan made no comment after the match, as he had to rush straight off to Umpiring duties. But as he sat in the traffic chaos that always greats the opening of a Uni term, he may have been thinking something along the lines of, We were made to work hard for that, but I feel the score was a fair reflection of the play of the two teams. Our finishing was better than Spaldings, as was our goalkeeping, and if we finished the match blowing a bit, we had work hard previously to earn ourselves a decent lead. Having something to defend really helped.

Cambridge beat Long Sutton in both fixtures between the teams last season and this trend looked set to continue when the home side started with vigour and passion. Long Sutton were given very little time on the ball and struggled to get into the game at any point in the match. The Cambridge midfield and forwards linked up well and created opportunities throughout the first half, and at half time it was 4-0 with goals from Tim Clapp (twice), Eliot Read and one from sweeper Chris Graveling.
The second half continued in the same vein as the first, as the home side were keen to ensure that Long Sutton were given no chances to get back into the game.

South came into the match eager to get their league campaign proper going, after last weeks opposition failed to fulfil the fixture. This desire was soon evident from vice-captain Gareth Hebbron, who took it a bit far in conversing with the Umpire, which earned him a stern talking to and a green card. A somewhat fractious tone was set for the first half, as inside the opening ten minutes a St. Ives defender had also been greened for chirping away at the Umpires, who made it clear they were not going to entertain such nonsense. In the midst of all the debate some hockey was played, with South fashioning a good chance when Colin Singleton made a great run to be unmarked in the circle, Rob Barton found him with a good cross from the left flank, but the St. Ives keeper was equal to Colins shot.
South were not playing to the level they would wish during the opening half, with the ball speed being poor compounded by players waiting on passes instead of coming to get them. Also there was slack marking in both defence and central midfield seeing players free. They faults were punished from a short corner awarded with only seconds left in the half. Before it could be taken, time expired, allowing the hosts to push up their entire team, and eventually the South defence were outmanoeuvred by sheer weight of numbers with a player flicking home easily from a yard.
South came out better in the second half. The defence and midfield were much more tigerish in their marking, and the passing was sharper. An equalised was fashion from a move down the right involving Samin Ishtiaq and Matt Kern. Tristen Knights initial shot was saved by the keeper, but the ball ran free and was eventually forced home by former Saint Rob Barton, who seemed happy to have scored against his old teammates.
It was South who came closest to winning the match, with two very near things. First a sweeping counter-attack after a Saints short corner had broken down finished with Tristen rounding the keeper, only to have the ball whipped off his stick before he could roll it into the open net, by a defender who had sprinted the length of the field to make the tackle. Even closer was a Rob shot from close range than hit the post and rolled away from the South players following up.
Skipper Kevin Rowland was pleased with the will to win of his side, commenting ""We were slow out the blocks in the first half and played with much more confidence in the second.

Although there were many shooting chances, including a disallowed John Greaves effort, none were converted, mainly due to the excellent March keeper, and the half remained goalless. Greaves also managed a spectacular rolling double twist fall as he collided with the keeper.
March grabbed the lead mid way through the second half after a period when they had gained the upper hand, as CSouth couldnt keep the ball away from their midfield playmaker, and home players started to dwell on the ball too long. The goal only served to reinvigorate CSouth who got back into the groove, and produced a flood of chances, one saved miraculously by a defended on the line, and the woodwork denying others.

Cambridge South, proudly sponsored by PwC, grabbed a point from a hard fought draw with Market Deeping on Saturday. Market Deeping had won both encounters last season and are amongst the pre-season favourites to achieve promotion, but they were never comfortable in this game against a passionate Cambridge South.
Shortly into the first half, the visitors opened the scoring with a quick counter-attack. However, the home side soon took the lead themselves, through Chris Graveling, twice sweeping home from short corners, making it 6 goals in 2 games for the in-form sweeper. Market Deeping dug deep and hit back with an equaliser to force Cambridge onto the back foot, but the hosts were the next to score when Rob Garrett buried a shot into the corner from the top of the D.
Cambridge South scored again shortly after the break, Eliot Reed shooting home through a crowd, to make it 4-2. This prompted a period of sustained pressure from Market Deeping, which eventually resulted in two goals in quick succession. The final 15 minutes were frantic as the away side looked to steal all three points, but the home side's defence held firm.
Captain Chris Baker was pleased with the overall performance, commenting ""This was a fiercely fought competitive match, which could have ended with either side gaining the 3 points.

South began the game as the stronger side, and it was little surprise when they took the lead, Rob Barton running on to Russell Johnsons through ball, drawing the keeper and slipping home. March reacted strongly to this goal, and began to dominate territory and possession, exploiting disorganised marking in the away defence. An equaliser was forced when runners into the circle were not picked up, and a shot from distance found its way in past some defensive sticks. And the hosts were ahead when a player was left all alone in the circle, from where he turned the ball past South keeper Lino Di Lorenzo at the second attempt.
South fought back towards the end of the half, with short corners being their main attacking weapon. Centre-back Dave Monck was centimetres wide with one powerful shot, which proved a useful sighter for a drive at the next short that rocketed into the corner, leaving the sides all-square at the interval. Souths short were causing March problems, and a routine early in the second period saw them edge ahead for the second time in the match. Monck this time passing up the direct shot to switch the ball left for Finn Johnson to sweep into the far corner. March did not lie down, and pulled level through a short of their own, finished with a neat flick over the prone Di Lorenzo.
The decisive goal came with 15 minutes remaining, when a South clearance was picked up on their 25 by the March captain. He drove to the byline, and pulled the ball back for his centre-forward to sweep into the far corner.

Horncastle proved to be a well-oiled team that used space well and created offensive pressure from the start. Souths defence stepped up and provided an impressive challenge for the away side. Commanded by Dave Monck as sweeper, the marking was tight and disciplined. Composed performances and clearances from Dave Bartram, Neil Sneade and Ron Oren meant that their attacks were stumped without risk of allowing the opposition repossession in Souths 25-yard area. It was this that kept the score line to 1-0 in the away teams favour.
Souths midfield and forwards struggled to create a flowing passing and possession game against a team that were keen to dispossess them of the ball. Whilst the midfield battle was bravely fought South needed to up the ball pace and accuracy of their passes, spending as little time on the ball as possible to avoid the oppositions tackles and interceptions.
After a robust team talk at half time South came back into the game and exhibited some of the hockey that the team is well able to perform. Snappy passing and running into space from Gareth H, Dave Stock led to the ball reaching forward Mark Taylor who put in a strong ball into the D which led to a disallowed Goal by Kevin Rowland, for what was described as dangerous ball in. The decision reflected what seemed to be a string of unlucky calls on South from the umpires. Rob Barton, Finn Johnson and Mark Taylor looked dangerous when South worked the ball up but a sturdy defence frustrated efforts to finish.
Gareth Hebbron was in a generous mood and shared his misdemeanours with both umpires, receiving a green card from each for something in the rules about barging. Winning him a unanimous lemon of the match. Dave Monck exhibited equal passion for winning the ball leading to flooring 3 members of the opposition with more panache than Gareth, none the less something the England Rugby team would of have been in awe of.
James Cobbe was making good use of the space he was given in the wide midfield but didnt get the opportunities he deserved to show how he can rattle any defence, wide distribution was lacking. Horncastle scored 4 goals from short corners, with only 1 in open play, an impressive offensive move up the pitch.
Tristen Knight had stepped up to fill the keepers position today and proved what an all rounder he is. Reading the game well, running out to clear the ball from Horncastles attacks and saving a penalty flick in the second half earned him a much-deserved man of the match.
Again today, the team showed that they are not a squad that will let their heads hang when under the cosh with hard running back by Colin Singleton to defend and every member putting in maximum effort to deny Horncastle further scoring opportunities in open play.
Consistent passing, build up play would have created more openings for South and is something to work on. Reflecting on the game Skipper Kev Rowland felt that  the never say die attitude of the team is impressive, some might find it hard to pull many positives out of a 5-0, but up against this very strong opposition every man kept his composure, kept pushing to go on the offensive and supported the back four totally.

Cambridge South 3rds, sponsored by PwC, lost the first one decisively due to sloppy marking, giving the ball away too easily, and allowing the star playmaker of the Spalding team to run rings round them. Three of Spalding's first half goals came from short corners, with a catalogue of deflections off defenders' anatomies making it difficult for the keeper to save. CSouth had few chances, as their attacks broke down outside the D, but Tom Rosselli got close to a great goal, arriving at speed by the post as the Spalding defence assumed the ball was going out of play, only to fail by a whisker to make contact.
Moving on...
The second half was much more even, as CSouth, with a reshuffled formation, built some good attacks, often involving the lively Simon Ta, who was unlucky to have a good goal disallowed, and could have had others. Suk Pannu in central midfield continued to be at the centre of many attacks and was tireless and positive throughout. Spalding did get one goal, but the excellent Shahbaz kept out shot after shot, and became ever more aggressive with his kicks. Finally the away team got a deserved consolation goal from the final short corner of the game, as Joe Williamson deflected a Greaves strike round the keeper at the far post.
Hopefully this game was a hiccough, as CSouth fell foul of a slick Spalding side containing some wily hockey players used to higher leagues, but the second half performance showed that they can compete at that level, and with discipline, match a team with more ball skills.

St. Ives had the better of the opening exchanges, but Cambridge South 4ths, sponsored by PwC, eventually settled down and created chances of their own through the skill and persistence of James Pope, Matt Murray and Seb Robins.
South however went 0-1 behind as St. Ives just shaded it in terms of possession. South went into half time having drawn level through a Matt strike. South also had a disallowed effort from a James short corner, but both sides seemed contented with 1-1 at half time.
A good half time team talk resulted in a slight change of tactics the second half for South where Shahzad Ali was sent further up field to disrupt the St. Ives well organised defence by going deep and dragging wide. This resulted in South looking more likely to score in the second half. St. Ives were a good side and they edged in front 1-2 through a short corner. Moments later Shahzad managed to put the ball in the St. Ives net through a quickly taken free hit by James Pope from the half way line, South's tactical change worked a treat, but alas the goal was frustratingly disallowed.
South eventually claimed an equaliser through Seb, but it took the umpires quite sometime before the goal was actually awarded. A hat trick of disallowed goals would have been hard to take. Both team continued to search for winner but the defences held out.

Cambridge fought hard and nearly scored when Rob Garrett raced through onto Mark Taylor's pass behind the defence but he couldn't find the target after the keeper pushed him wide. Before this, Tring had scored a couple of good goals, one a flick to the top of the goal from a short corner.
The second half continued in the same manner as the first, and although Cambridge were able to enjoy more possession and threatened the Tring goal more often, they struggled to match the away side's passing and movement.

Thus South nipped in the bud what had been shaping up into a worrying start to the season, with the side now sitting in mid-table with the chance to build on towards the hoped for promotion campaign, in what is a pretty tight division this season (by last Saturday there were no unbeaten teams left, rather early for that to be the case).
South had begun this derby on the front foot, passing and moving into space to pull the Nomads side around. Probing attacks were occurring, but the Nomads defence had dropped back to the edge of their own circle and held that line very effectively, with Souths territorial dominance not seeing many chances produced.
Nomads 4th Xi had been struggling for players due to it being half-term week, and were forced to rely on some players sticking around from their earlier 2nd Xi game. These players were obviously an issue for South to deal with, having skills used to a level higher than Division 5; conversely they each had one hard match in their legs already, so were not going to be the most mobile. In the last 15 minutes of the first half, Nomads managed to get these players onto the ball and forced South backwards. Some slack marking was seeing players free, and it need good reactions from keeper Ian Evans to keep the scores level, when he came flying off his line to dispossess a Nomad who was otherwise clean through.
That was Ians positive playing contribution of the half. He also added to the levity of the affair, when jogging to retrieve a ball for a South 16, he somehow managed to pitch himself into a headlong dive to the turf. Apparently My pads tripped me up!. On any other day, this piece of slapstick would be a guaranteed Lemon-of-the-match award winner, but on this occasion it wasnt even the most clown-like action of the half. That was left to vice-skipper Gareth Hebbron. Gareth was putting in a strong performance, which reminded all of just what a good player he is. But in the midst of this fine showing, he shouted for a ball to be passed to him on the top of the circle, lost his footing as it was coming towards him, skidded feet first into the orb and ended up sitting on it! Not elegant
South turned around at half-time level, with skipper Kevin Rowland calling for a return to the hockey of the opening twenty minutes. And it was quickly present. Determined play in the midfield meant that South were exerting a near stranglehold on territory and possession. Nomads were forced to play on the break, but with man-of-the-match Leo Tomita organising his defence superbly, and George Wych at centre-back giving a master class in the art of the jab tackle, Nomads didnt manage a single shot on target in the entire period.
In the attacking zone, South were still probing away, looking for that crucial goal. It nearly came when James Cobbe worked a yard for himself in the left corner, and picked out Colin Singleton in space in the circle with a superb cross. Colins first-timer was good for connection, but awry in terms of radar. Going into the last ten minutes, just when South were looking like they might run out of time, they were giving a helping hand by Nomads, who took a poor 16-yard hit that Stuart Creed cut out on the 25. Stu shipped the ball instantly right to Samin Ishtiaq, who fired a hard ball in goalwards, where Dave Stock was on hand to flick into the corner of the net. Speed of thought, and of action, passing the ball first or second touch = victory. You couldnt ask for a more perfect demonstration of it than this goal. It was home before the Nomads midfield had had a chance to get back amongst the South players to disrupt things.
Skipper Kev was delighted by the efforts his team had showed in the second period, commenting ""We gained a well earned and much needed 3 points today against Nomads who featured 4 of their 2nd XI squad. We had good periods today where we played our better hockey, a passing and moving game but we absolutely must learn to do this for the full 70 mins.

After an initial settling period, South began to dominate possession and created a number of openings but failed to put them away, mostly due to good goal keeping by Peterborough keeper, but also some rusty finishing.
The first goal eventually came through some slick passing between James Pope and Joe Williamson, culminating in Seb Robins putting the ball into the net. The South defence was rarely troubled in the opening period. South was even more dominant in the second half and there was even less for the defence to do; Shahbaz Ali, South's keeper started dancing on the pitch to keep himself entertained!
South eventually got the second goal that provided the necessary cushion. The goal came from a move down the right and was pushed into the net by Tom Rosselli, at the second attempt. After that South created chance after chance and Tom scored 2 more goals to complete his first hat trick of the season.

Peterborough's parsimonious defence had only conceded three goals in their five games prior to South's visit, so the four strikes the visitors managed was a fine achievement.
Yet again South were led from the back, as sweeper Chris Graveling plundered another two goals from short corner routines, helping South to a 2-0 halftime lead. These strikes mean Graveling remains as an unlikely leading scorer for his side, with 8 league goals so far, all of them scored via South's sweetly functioning set pieces.
Peterborough struck back shortly after the break, but South dug deep to re-establish their two-goal lead through striker Mark Taylor, who, having had a goal ruled out in the first half, finally managed to break his duck since joining the club in the summer. As Peterborough pressed forward late on to try and pull another goal back, South caught them cold with a classic counter attack, finished again by Taylor.

Boston had arrived at the Leys with a 100% record, unfortunately not the one you wish for, as their previous five games had yielded no points. This gave South confidence, and we were at their throats from the first minute, forcing the first of many saves from the Boston goalkeeper.
After the good start, Boston showed South that they could play, with a good ten minute spell when South struggled to clear their own half. A couple of shorts were given away, including one where an on-target shot hit a defenders foot. He may not have actually been the last man, but on another day, this might have been given as a penalty flick.
Having started the match, stopped again, and weathered what Boston could throw at us, South opened the scoring. Neat interplay between the forwards saw Rob Garrett and Rob Barton play a one-two on the halfway line that left Garrett running on a diagonal into the circle. He drew the keeper and slid the ball back square for Barton to tap home.
Settled by being in front, South were now in full control, and forcing regular saves from Bostons keeper (who, btw, had an exceptional game in keeping the score manageable). With so much territorial advantage, there was a temptation for Souths defence to edge forwards to try and help, leaving some large spaces for Boston to run into if they could get hold of the ball. One such counter-thrust, in the closing seconds of the half, saw Bostons centre-forward through one-on-one on South 'keeper Tristen Knight. Tristen came flying out to the top of his circle, and smothered the ball well, with the rapidly retreating defence clearing the rebound. As the first half had ended, the second half began, with Bostons danger man in clean through on Tristen. This time he played his flick earlier to beat Souths stopper, maybe too early as the defenders scrambling back were able to shepherd the ball wide.
A scare for the backline, as South should have had the game wrapped up already. And seemingly in the spirit of I dont want to feel that nervous again, the killer second goal was almost entirely a defenders own work. Sweeper Dave Monck picked up a loose ball on his own 25, and charged into some yawning midfield spaces. He drew in the Boston left-back, and slipped the ball to South right-winger Samin Ishtiaq. Samin bounced it back to Dave, who headed for the circle. Another neat triangular one-two to take a defender was played with Rob G in the right channel, and once again the ball was with the bullocking defender, who was by now into the circle and winding up the howitzer. Daves first time shot was marvellously placed/scuffed into the far corner of the goal, depending on your point of view.
Souths front pair of Robs combined for the third. Barton slipped to Garrett on the top of the circle. Garrett pushed down the left channel to the byline, round the outside of his defender, and with the reverse stick squared the ball across the face of goal, where Barton was on hand to tap home. Simple stuff. A final goal was added when Samin picked up an attempted Boston clearance, and slipped a pass to skipper Kevin Rowland. Kevs shot was going wide of the right post, only for Colin Singleton to appear on the byline and pick up the ball very neatly on his reverse stick, a single decisive touch which took Col from being out of possession outside the posts to being in possession, behind the keeper, directly in front of goal, inches out. The ball was gently rolled the ball home.
Kev was happy with the win, saying The 1-0 scoreline at half time illustrates how we have been a bit slow out the traps of late, but the team turned this start around in the second half and got the goals and the 3 points we deserved. An important win that leaves us in a healthy position in the league

Sadly this was also true of Rutland's midfield and attack, and the home side scored twice in the first half, once when CSouth keeper was unsighted and again as a result of multiple deflections off defenders. Nevertheless CSouth kept plugging away and had their share of possession, often set up by Paul South and James Pope in midfield or Andy Lewis, back in his favourite left wing position causing havoc.
Rutland grabbed more goals, the third from a brilliant flick into the top of the net from a short corner, and two more as CSouth failed to cover after losing the ball. In spite of a seemingly hopeless situation, CSouth kept at it, and were rewarded by a Lewis goal, as the winger pounced on to a free hit to blast the ball into goal from a few yards out. Although the away team had a number of attacks, with John Greaves and Andy Lewis unlucky not to score, it was always Rutland who looked in control, with neat passing moves often taking the ball up the pitch faster than CSouth expected.

The game started at a fast pace and Cambridge South 4ths, sponsored by PwC, went ahead after about 5 minutes through a free hit taken at the half way line found Kevin Pride, who finished with aplomb. Newmarket picked up the pace and dominated the midfield as well as creating attacks from the back through a particularly skilful and quick player. South's experienced defence of Jim Sutcliffe, Ian Glover, David Bridge, Ky Ho, alongside keeper Shahbaz Ali, held their own for a good 15 minutes, with Shahbaz making many good stops. But Newmarket's superior possession and pace eventually gave them the equaliser they deserved. Newmarket then went 1-2 up through a unusual goal, the attacker accidentally looped his shot towards goal, in an attempt to try to push it away with the stick above his head, Shahbaz managed only to push it into his own net!
An interval re-arrangement of Souths resources saw them begin to take charge of the midfield in the second period, with the Newmarket's defence was made to work. Two more strikes from deadly Kevin Pride made it 3-2 to South, his first hat trick of the season. South should have finished the game off with another goal, but it was Newmarket who made the most of a confused situation where a short corner was initially awarded and then changed to be a free hit just outside the D. South's defence was still lining up when a shot came in and a Newmarket forward made the most of the situation and it was 3-3.
Newmarket missed at least a couple of chances with an goal open and South also had their fair share of chances. 3-3 seemed a fair result. A well earned draw as the team showing good fighting spirit, togetherness and can even score goals.

South arrived at the pitch nice and early, giving time to shake the journey up from our legs, and for an in-depth tactical discussion from skipper Kev Rowland. The whiteboard was brought all the way along, only for the team to ban it on superstitious grounds, i.e. it hadnt appeared before the wins against Nomads or Boston so it wasnt wanted now This left Kev reading from his notes and sketching shapes on the wall. After a warm-up including an early candidate for Lemon of the day from Finn Johnson, who helpfully sought to return a ball the previous Ladies match had lost over the astro fencing by lobbing back, into the middle of the pitch, as the game was progressing, it was time to start.
From push-back, a lovely move saw South straight into the Alford circle. Kev in central mid rolled the ball to Jan Brynjolffssen at right-back, on to Gareth Hebbron in central mid and out to Samin Ishtiaq on the right-wing. Samin burst down the line and crossed, the home defence scrambling the ball away. Alford responded instantly as an intercepted sideline pass saw the South defence out of position, Alford's dangerous no.15 unmarked and on the ball in the circle, from where he shot against Lino Di Lorenzos far post, the defence clearing the rebound. A frantic opening which set the pattern for a dramatic game.
Alford were the first team to register, when no.15 set off on a dribble from outside the 25 that took him into the circle. He wound up on the reverse and hit a rising shot that Lino did well to parry down. Unfortunately the ball dropped behind the South stopper, spinning wildly and being drawn slowly into the goal. Linos desperate attempt to sweep away from his goalline was unsuccessful.
Souths response was instant, and well worked. James Pope picked up a ball in midfield and passed early to find Samin in acres of space on the right flank. Samin advanced to byline and pulled the ball back to the penalty spot, where centre-forward Rob Barton was lurking. Robs touch on the cross turned it into the far corner, and things were all-square again. The rest of the half was characterised by midfield battling, with Ron Oren at centre-back prominent in keeping the ball a safe distance away from the South goal. Alford did cut through dangerously once when a ball across the face of the goal seemed certain to be turned home, only for a brilliant last ditch effort from Colin Singleton, racing in from the left wing, denying a player on the penalty spot, with left-back Andy Passmore sweeping the scraps away to safety.
The second half was an action packed affair. The first incident of note was when Alford were unlucky to have a goal chalked off, as prior to the ball going in the Umpire had whistled to award them a penalty corner. Later in the half, exactly the same frustration would occur for South, as Finns scrambled goalmouth attempt would be denied, with a short awarded instead. Throughout the game, Alford were forcing numerous short corners, the final count was reckoned to be 20+. The South backline was doing a good job of restricting the number of shots these shorts produced, but the few that did get through foundered on post-men Jan and Andy, who both made goalline clearances of otherwise certain scores, Andy doing so on more than one occasion.
One of Jans clearances involved a solid contact with the stick, but not enough to prevent the forward motion of the ball. It then struck his toe, and looped wildly up into the air, somehow going over the bar and ending on the roof of the net. Everyone stopped expecting a flick or at least a short to be awarded, only for the Umpire to give a long corner. An odd decision, made even more so when the Umpire explained after the incident that he had seen the ball hit both stick AND boot. All Hail the Glory of the Hypnotoad! <http://www.lhaddix.net/htoad.htm>
Even Jans mysterious power over Umpires couldnt help with another Alford short soon afterwards, as once again a shot flashed in that struck his foot. This time it was further away from the line, more dubious whether the ball was on target, and also he might not have been the last men, but on balance the right decision was to award the flick. Alfords danger man stepped up to take it, Lino gave him the eye, and he promptly scuffed the shot straight down the middle for an easy save <http://www.lhaddix.net/htoad.htm>.
Compared to Alfords inefficient short routine, Souths looked sharp. The first they were awarded in the second period saw a neat move return to the ball back to injector James. James shot was half-saved, the ball running free across the goalline. Samin, on the far post, seemed certain to score, only for a last ditch tackle preventing him forcing it over the line. Chastened by this warning, Alford came on again, forced another short, and finally found reward. A clean inject and a powerful connection were too much this time for Lino and Andy, the ball squeezing its way past them both.
Time was running out for South, and the prospect of a two-and-a-quarter hour car journey after a narrow defeat was looming. This unpleasant thought spurred the visitors into ever greater efforts, with vice captain Gareth going on a mazy dribble into the circle that drew a foul and a second short of the half. This time the routine was sweetness itself, James injected, Ron stopped, Kev faked to shoot and slipped right to Rob, who drew the 'keeper and passed square for Finn, waiting on the penalty spot, to slap home.
With little more than five minutes remaining the game became even more frantic. Alford forced at least three more shorts, but couldnt find a shot on target, whilst for South Gareth went on another coruscating run through the hosts tiring defence, getting into the circle and lifting a reverse stick flick towards the top corner that the Alford 'keeper padded away well.
Kev was pleased with his teams efforts in the game, saying It was a long trip to Skegness and the teams desire not to come away empty handed was shown by their hard work and commitment on the day.

However, they found the Deeping rearguard desperately hard to penetrate, with moves repeatedly petering out after crossing the 25-yard line. The visiting keeper had some saves to make during the match, but none that would be considered to have really extended him.
Deeping played a counter-attacking game, relying on a frontman known to be sharp at this level to link their play together. The danger man got the decisive goal in the dying moments of the opening period with a shot that deflected off the legs of a defender to deceive 'keeper Ian Evans, the ball grazing the near post as it found the target. Deepings front line kept the South defence on their toes all match, playing a high line which stopped full-backs from overlapping down the flanks. The visiting forwards were also interchanging positions, which the South defence, who put in a decent shift, were covering successfully.
South pressed throughout the second period, forcing a number of short corners. But with the set piece routine also malfunctioning, it gradually became clear that the points would be heading back up the A14. The final whistle provide a picture of the differing emotions, Deeping arms in the air cheering a victory that ended a recent losing run, South chins on chests unable to believe they had got nothing from such a winnable game.
Skipper Kevin Rowland was deeply disappointed with the day, saying We should have taken the 3 points on paper today, but we failed to look dangerous within their 25 yard area. A disappointing and frustrating result. Some real hard work and stiff reflection on todays events is needed to raise our game if we dont want to finish near the bottom of the league by the Christmas break.

The away team dominated from the start, and Steve Fleck, having arrived just in time for the push back, netted a quick fire hattrick inside 20 minutes. The first was from a James Pope free hit, which Fleck pounced on, swiftly followed by a mesmerising solo run from the half way line ending with a neat shimmy past the keeper. The third was relatively tame, as James Pope laid the ball off for Fleck to blast in.
Skipper John Greaves got in on the act soon after when a Paul South hit into the D found him lurking with intent 3 yards out to slide the ball calmly past a wrongfooted keeper.
Shortly after half time James Pope turned from assist-master into scorer when a thunderbolt effort from a short corner proved unstoppable. By this stage CSouth were well on top, with everyone playing their part, from the solid, watertight GloverEvansLee defence, through a classy CreedDikstraPopeFleckSouth midfield to the lively GreavesLewis attack. Even the guest star keeper Tim Poole, enticed out of retirement, did his bit, particularly when his teammates went through a brief period of concentration lapse, diving at the feet of attackers as if he had never been away. John Greaves scored the final goal as he delicately deflected a Stuart Creed effort which was going wide into the net from his (relatively) safe range of 6 inches.
St Neots were not a bad team, and never gave up. On this occasion they came up short against 11 CSouth players all playing well, as a team. The CSHC 3rds promotion push is maintained.

Wisbech equalised soon after before Michael Thorogood restored Cambridge South's lead. Wisbech again drew level, though, before Rupert Webb finished off a short corner routine on the stroke of half-time to give the home side a 3-2 lead.

A distinct lack of defenders had seen South go into the game with centre-forward Rob Barton filling in as sweeper, a role in which he would offer a solid performance. However, with this new look defence, South found themselves struggling to clear their lines in the opening minutes. Shorts were given away, and from the third of these, a rebound from a save from keeper Lino Di Lorenzo was lifted high into the net.
From the re-start, South began to play, a neat move finding Samin Ishtiaq in space, Samins flick drawing the first of a string of saves from the Peterborough keeper. South kept probing, and had another good chance when Simon Ta was millimetres short of a tap in on the far post, after a driven cross from Samin, but the hosts were also looking dangerous on the break as their quick young forwards interchanged neatly. Mid-way through the half it was 2-0, again from a short; the initial move seemed to break down, but with the defence converging on the ball, one simple pass found a player in acres of space and he cracked hard into the bottom corner.
South again came very close to pulling a goal back when James Cobbe played an aerial down the left touchline to strike partner Simon, whose touch in plucking the ball out of the air was classy, leaving him to able to outpace the last defender. Simon tried to round the keeper, who got a slight touch on the ball, forcing him wide and having to stop to regain composure for his shot. This gave time for a defender to scramble back to his goalline and block the effort.
Peterborough scored a deflating third from a quick break soon afterwards, a late runner appearing in the circle to nip in front of some static defenders to touch the ball home. However, South earned themselves a lifeline in the dying minutes of the half from a short corner. Kevin Rowland attempted to slip the ball left to Paul South, Paul miss-controlled neatly into the path of Simon, who swept smartly into the far corner.
The second period was an end-to-end affair, as South looked for the goal that would get them back into the game. Whilst Peterborough remained a danger throughout, the home goalkeeper was the busier of the two. The closest South came was the result of counter-attack that saw Simon burst through a high last line of defence, near halfway. He advanced into the circle, went around the keeper but then, as the angle rapidly narrowed, was unable to achieve a solid enough connection on the reverse stick, the ball drifting wide.
Time ran out with South still probing for a way back into the match. Skipper Kev was looking for positives from the performance, saying ""Despite the score line there was plenty to get from the game, good team passing and possession was high which meant we created plenty of threatening play in their half. Weve got to put some focus on converting the build up into goals to get the points we need"".

They faced a Rutland team with the usual mix of youthful speed and steady experience found in this league. Early exchanges were cagey with few clear chances at either end. Gradually South were able to apply more pressure and Andy Lewis, John Greaves and James Raikes were all unfortunate not to score on several occasions, denied by a combination of misfortune, good goalkeeping and final touches not quite finding their mark. At the other end Rutland were not fashioning as many chances but still had moments that stretched the South defence into scrambled clearances or good saves from Shahbaz Ali.

As the second half started South continued to keep the pressure on but were still unable to convert. It was beginning to look like a scoreless draw was on the cards but with ten minutes remaining James Raikes picked up the ball just inside the Rutland half, slipped it to Ian Glover running up the centre who managed to draw the keeper before slipping to Andy Lewis to hammer home.

Unfortunately it was a lead that South couldn't maintain as their opposition pushed forward with renewed vigour. A short corner shot was parried but couldn't be cleared before falling to the injector who fired in from short range. Despite a helter-skelter last few minutes the one-one scoreline stood at the end. A frustrating draw against a team that South had chances to put away.

The teams were evenly matched in the first half as the home side enjoyed more possession but were unable to create any clear-cut chances. South were happy to attack on the break, utilising their fast pace up front, and it was on one of these breakaways that they opened the scoring. Robert Garrett carried the ball into the D and slipped it beneath the on-rushing goalkeeper. The University hit back soon after, before Chris Graveling restored Cambridge South's lead via a short-corner. The home side equalised for a second time to leave the score 2-2 at half time.

A win for Cambridge South would have put them level with University in third place in the league, but the recently relegated home side were keen to continue their push for promotion this season, and pressed hard in the second half for the winner. Cambridge South, though, created the first clear chance of the half and only a goal-line clearance kept the scores level. The home side did break through eventually, and two goals in the space of ten minutes effectively sealed the win for the students.

South now lie in 5th in the league and will look to get back to winning ways against March Town 2nds next week.

The division between the upper and lower half of the league table has been stretching.

After the first whistle, the St. Neots squad left the blocks quicker than the home team. For the first fifteen minutes, St. Neots moved the ball intelligently with their midfield and created good pressure in Souths half. Some loose marking during this stage of play made for a few heart in the mouth moments that led to scrambles in the D to clear the ball.

Souths first real opportunity was after a short corner was awarded halfway through the first half. The ball was stopped effectively from push-out and Kev Rowland took a shot that bamboozled the goalkeeper, coming off his right leg and into the goal. The plan at this stage was to keep this lead until halftime or build on it. However, quick build-up play by St. Neots led to the ball being played into Souths D, where two forwards were waiting unmarked. This left keeper Lino Di Lorenzo exposed and resulted in a relatively easy goal. South pushed hard before halftime to regain the advantage. However, the second half began at one all.

Having raised their game in the last twenty minutes of the first half, South consolidated their dominance in the second half. Finn Johnson looked comfortable in central midfield with Gareth Hebron, working together to create play across the park, using the wide players who were consistently finding space. Matt Kern, making a welcome return, drove the ball effectively up the right wing linking with the forwards well. Colin Singletons fitness and tenacity as always was impressive, with well considered and accurate passing, contributing to the greater South possession of the ball. Dave Stock showed his all round skills, involved with the build-ups and ensuring that he was there in a defensive role, pushing their wide player into stifled play.

Souths second short corner of the match was slipped right by Kev to Rob Barton with hunger for goals in his eyes, he looked up for a pass across the goal to waiting attackers, however he intelligently sized up the situation in a second, took the ball round a player and shot at the gap he noted a millisecond earlier. Great finish to put South up 2-1. Rob consolidated his form later in the half, finishing off a flowing end-to-end move that began when right at the back when Lino kicked clear to right-back Jan Brynjolffssen. Jan passed down the wing to Matt, who drove the ball forward before making an accurate pass to Rob, in space high on the left side of the circle. It could only mean one thinga reverse stick sweep, which took flight catching the keeper by surprise, into top right of the goal. 3-1 South.

St Neots pushed hard with counter attacks but with the South defence, being organised well by Ron Oren the marking looked increasingly disciplined. The tackles by Jan, George Wych and Andy Passmore just in front off and in the D looked clean, composed and skilful greatly frustrating the visiting side. Any lesser skills would have led to many short corners being conceded. These were few and notably well defended by the back 5. Lino quickly hitting the deck during one to make great save with his stick at the right post, and Jan stopping a shot with his stick just in front of the corner injector, who was waiting to turned it into the goal.

Souths final goal started with an accurate clearance from Andy down the left wing into acres of unguarded space. Finn chased hard to retrieve the ball before it went dead, took the ball to the outside of the D put in a pacey cross to a waiting Kev who got the ball under control and quickly swept the ball inside the left post left exposed by the keeper.

4-1 South, who were the far better team on the day, especially the partnership of Kev and Rob up front, which worked well. Captain Kev Rowland was delighted with the team performance today every member of the team looked good out there today, they played with composure and intelligence in their own roles and as team.

Luckily they did and all 11 played their part in a convincing victory over a rather physical but fit and ""up for it"" mid table opposition.

The first goal took time to arrive but a Greaves-Pope short corner routine did the trick, with James Pope manoeuvring the ball well to get in his shot, which thundered into the back board. Long Sutton had the better of the play for a period in the second half but one wonder save and all round dominance of the penalty area by goalkeeper Lino Di Lorenzo meant that they got in few shots. Andy Lewis, who had been a threat throughout along with James Pope, the tigerish Rupert Espley and Paul South attacking from midfield, wrapped up the scoring. Lewis dribbled seemingly away from danger, and shot from a narrow angle, confusing the defence who could only parry the ball into the net.

CSouth had had enough other chances including one great move ending with a Greaves shot against a post, and other efforts from Espley, Pope and Lewis, but were unable to improve their goal difference further. This performance, with no weak links, great commitment, some smart hockey, and desire to help one another throughout, keeps CSouth 3rds near the top of the table.

After last week's defeat the home side were keen to end the year on a high, but they seemed half-asleep in the first half as they struggled to gain control of the match. The only team below March in the league are Long Sutton, and they've yet to register a point all season. Nonetheless, March were holding Cambridge South to 1-1 at half time.

South began the brighter of the two teams, pinning Newmarket back. The hosts struggled to clear the South press for much of the opening ten minutes. However, when Newmarket did work a ball through, their forwards were interlinking well, moving the South defence around to find space. This opening period set the pattern of the match, South dominating territory and trying to force errors, Newmarket looking to hold possession deep and to spring swift counters.
It was Newmarket who fashioned the first really clear-cut chance of the game, when a powerful strike from a short corner beat South keeper Lino Di Lorenzo only to smash off the post. A Newmarket forward following up seemed certain to turn the rebounding ball into the gapping net, only for it to come at him too sharply meaning he fluffed the contact, allowing Neil Sneade to sweep to safety.
Minutes later Newmarket had an even better opportunity when they were awarded a penalty stroke. South were shocked at the decision, mostly because strokes are rarely awarded in Division 5NW for anything other than feet on the line, and the infraction in this case seemed fairly minor. However the rules of the game give a long list of other offences that ought to result in a stroke, with the those in the South team who had a view of the incident and an Umpiring qualification all concurring post-game with the match officials decision. Either way, a stroke it was. Newmarkets talented young county player stepped up to take it, got a good connection, maybe too good as the ball flashed past the outside of the top left corner. Apparently the last time this player took a flick at Lino, he missed wide of the bottom right corner. What with the duffed flick at Alford, Lino clearly has the Indian sign over 5NW flick takers!
South made full use of these escape when they took the lead in the closing phase of the first half. Newmarkets centre-back dawdled on the ball, allowing Rob Barton to close him down. When the defender tried to trick his way out of trouble, Rob didnt buy it. Rob knocked the ball loose to strike partner Kevin Rowland, who was the only player, apart from the Newmarket keeper, in the circle. Kev had vast amounts of time to control, steady himself, and drive the ball hard into the bottom right corner of the exposed stoppers net.
South started the second period at pace, and seemed certain to make it 2-0 when some neat interpassing saw the keeper rounded. Though the ball ran loose from the initial thrust, it fell to Stuart Creed, who, with the goal yawing, seemed certain to score. However the position of the ball forced Stu into a shooting with a reverse stick sweep, which, in the conditions, unsurprisingly was a poor contact. It still seemed certain that Simon Ta would finish the chance off, but he couldnt sort his feet and stick out in time to turn the loose ball home, the defence had got back, and the opportunity had gone.
Like Newmarket before them, South were made to pay for not making the most of glorious chances. They were not helped by a period of unnecessarily panicky defending, as three times defenders, with time on the ball to get their heads up and pick a pass, opted instead to try and whack balls straight upfield, through a crowd. Each time the Newmarket midfield were comfortably able to stop the clearances, and recycle the ball back into Souths circle, the final time finding a player in the left channel, who made a good contact with the ball. Lino had this shot well covered, only to be beaten all ends up when it was deflected into the top corner via a defenders stick.
The final twenty minutes of the match saw the two teams stymied by the arctic, rain lashed conditions. Numb fingers, slippy stick handles, and a surface that some players footwear could find no purchase on (Finn Johnsons impersonation of an ice-skating giraffe will remain long in the memory), all contributed to a decline in both teams ability to pass accurately to each other, with the ball stuck in midfield for most of the remaining time. The nadir of this was reached when Jan Brynjolffssen tried to hit through a ball and totally lost grip of his stick, which went flying, wobblingly in the air like a decidedly unsmart missile, towards a knot of players who were rapidly seeking cover. Fairly lemon-like
One of the few remaining chances in the match came Souths way, when a James Pope free hit from the left touchline was flicked first by Rob, and then by Gareth Hebbron, the ball going agonisingly just wide of the wrong-footed keepers far post. All involved were pretty grateful to hear the final whistle and head somewhere warm and dry, with the spoils shared. Lets hope the weather for the return game in April is rather more conducive to playing hockey, so we can have a real test of who the better side is!
South skipper Kevin Rowland commented, ""The weather conditions on the day were one of the worst I can remember playing in, despite that the team put out a worthy performance and were the side that created the greater amount of play and threat for the full 3 points. Coming away with a point was the result of hard team work, we certainly enjoy the game more when we play well, and that we did"".

Matt Bailey at sweeper had a part in the first two goals, the first from an opposition short corner, which he neatly deflected with a carefully placed foot past keeper Lino Di Lorenzo into the net. Bailey atoned for this by storming up into the opposition D just in time to pounce on a loose ball, off an opposition foot this time, and equalise. CSouth took the lead through yet another fine Andy Lewis run and cross, which found its way to the waiting Suk Pannu who slotted the ball confidently into goal. Wisbech came right back just before half time as that man Bailey got a foot to a goalbound ball to concede a penalty stroke, which dribbled past Lino for 2  2.
After half time the game opened up, and both sides had attacking opportunities. John Benedikz and his defensive colleagues snuffed out Wisbech moves effectively, and the home attack continued to threaten, including one penalty stroke shout, and numerous crosses going begging near goal.

South opened the scoring inside the first couple of minutes. Samin pushed down the right-flank and crossed for Rob B, whose shot was saved by the Harlow keeper. However, a lack of communication in the visitors defence meant the ball wasnt cleared, allow Col to gather and rush into an empty net from a handful of yards. A soft goal, but a good start for South, who were always in control afterwards.
South controlled territory and possession throughout the 70 minutes, probing away at Harlows deep lying team. Despite the territorial dominance, chances were at a premium, and it was near the end of the half when Simon capitalised on another defensive lapse to break free in the right channel, and sweep home into the far corner.The second half was played out in a similar vein to the first, with South keeper Lino having little to do. In fact, after the game, Lino reckoned he had had to save one shot on target all match, with his only other significant touch of the ball being to race out of his circle to stick-sweep away when a through-ball had looked like it might split South open.
It took a spectacular save from the Harlow keeper to deny South a third goal, when he reacted swiftly to pad over the angle a shot of Simons that was heading for the top corner. Otherwise, that was all she wrote in terms of goalmouth action. Skipper Kev was pleased with the day, singling teenaged midfielder Finn out for a special mention, saying, A great way to finish the first half of the season, we had the lions share of possession and always looked the better side.

Nevertheless CSouth came back with a penalty flick, well taken by Suk Pannu. Unfortunately most attacks fizzled out after good work by the ever-threatening Russell Johnson and Andy Lewis, although Russell was very unlucky to hit the inside of the post after his own mazy run and shot.

With Peterborough languishing in the league below we were always hopeful that it'd be an easy game to shake off the mince pies and chocolates and, in the end, so it proved. A beautiful Saturday morning made for perfect hockey conditions and as the shouts of 'Happy New Year!' faded, the game began at a leisurely pace. Cheggers had a shortage of defenders but plethora of strikers so had switched Forrest to the back of the diamond, with Thorogood slotting into central defence. James Cobbe made his second appearance of the season, playing at left mid, which allowed Russ the chance to play up front for a game. Unfortunately he had to come off with ten minutes remaining after he twinged something in his leg - nothing too serious, we hope.
The game started slowly, but we were able to control the majority of the possession and contain Peterborough to only minor forays into our half. And soon enough the scoring was opened as the in-form Mark Taylor grabbed the first of his 4-goal haul. Mid-way through the half he added his second to make it 2-0 at half-time. Some stern words were spoken at half-time as Cheggers urged the team to up their game and show some proper hockey.
With more expansive play on show and some crisp passing, we managed to carve open their defence 4 more times in the game, despite some enthusiastic and optimistic goal keeping from the visitors (""Come on guys - 5-0 down and 10 minutes left, we can still win this!!""). Russ got on the score sheet (at last!) before Cheggers rounded off the win with a goal after JB made a mazy run from left back, via the right-wing and over to the left wing and on into the D, before unselfishly squaring the ball.

During the holiday feasting period it seemed the opposition had also started to eat each other, they turned up for this friendly game with only 9 men and no goalie.
An unusually prompt meet at the rendezvous meant South left in good time leaving plenty of time for Dave Monck, who swallowed a comedy store DVD, to generally entertain and use Kev for target practice with the football. Missing the ever-present Jan, not feeling up to a game whilst feeling unwell, a last minute reciprocal double up deal was struck for defenders with the 1sts, leading to the 2s gratefully guesting Jon Benedikz.
In order to make the oppositions numbers up Rob Garrett changed his umpire role to play for them, with time also put in by Dave Stock and Simon Ta; thanks guys. Their umpire kindly did the job solo and the game was played in good spirit.
A victory it might have been today, however no one was under any illusions; this was not our finest hour and selective memory will make the game reportage short! The first goal came from a square back stick cross from Rob Barton in the D to an unmarked Kev Rowland with enough time to stop the ball and push it at the far post. MDBA equalised with a short corner before half time where Lino showed off his comedy clown leg moves, timing these just right with a parting of the knees, as wide as the Red Sea path for Moses, to allow the ball through. Also performed with circus ring elegance in the game was the roller skate on one foot tumble over his own defenceplaying skittles he was.
Souths goals were not classics given the lack of an opposition goalkeeper. Rob Barton made it 2-1 after he worked at making himself a little room in their D. The third came from Dave Stock after prophesising that it would happen by shouting my goal, my goal as he ran down the centre of the pitch toward their D, waiting for the cross from Kev. Both Dave and Rob had made it clear from their markers and were both in viable positions to receive a pass, but clearly there was only one man for this job! Dave received the ball and with nay bother from defender.or keeper for that matter, finished and opened up the margin to 3-1. And a right hearty whooop he did give, hell relive that one in bed but I bet theres more defenders then ;o) and Baywatch starsprobably.
There was a host of missed opportunities to increase Souths scoreline; however these were replaced, at least by some small compensation, for comedy misses of open goals with Souths forwards doing the walk of shame back up the pitch. The opposition created a good number of offensive moves with some good passing and were apt at losing their marker in and around the D; however Souths defence kept the advantage we had gained.
The game itself was illustrative of a team that had had a break, looked a bit rusty and every member knew that we need to work to get some momentum towards regaining the quality Hockey the squad is capable of.
Skipper Kev Rowland reflected We have to account for post break play, get the first game under the belt and recognise what we need to do to get back to our league game. We have a tough friendly next week where we will have the opportunity to work towards doing that. The day itself was a very good one; it was great to have the team together in great spirits

They were better, and scored 4 good goals, against CSouth's one, albeit an excellent individual effort from Andy Lewis, who was lively throughout, and popped up to help the defence regularly as well as delivering frequent crosses.
Credit is also due to Shabhaz Ali - growing in confidence and tactical awareness, and beginning to dominate the goal mouth, with fearless dives and sharp saves, and Steve Fleck - his dodgy hip putting him in an unaccustomed defensive role at sweeper/centre back, both of which he played aggressively and effectively. Simon Harper also turned defence into attack with some great passes from midfield

A bright and pleasant day provided good conditions for the match, and the first half was an absorbing game of hockey as two evenly matched teams probed each other, looking for a way through. Ely enjoyed good possession but were unable to create any clear-cut opportunities until they managed to force a short-corner, from which a lucky deflection gave them the lead.
It wasn't long after, though, that Forrest got in behind the home side's defence from a break-away down the right wing. After drawing the keeper he slipped it square to the in-form Mark Taylor to slot into the open goal. South continued to create good chances the rest of the half but were unable to find the back of the net, and were punished when Ely broke from defence and scored on the counter-attack. 2-1 at half time but anyone's game, or so it should have been. Ely, however, had other ideas.
The game continued to be a close fought battle until the home side forced a third goal and South, for once, struggled to get back into the match. A top-draw reverse stick sweep was the pick of the home side's goals, but South will be disappointed to have made it so easy for Ely in the second half.
A much-improved performance will be needed when the teams meet in the league in a few weeks time.

South began in sprightly fashion, moving the ball around nicely and exerting some pressure on the Ely backline. However, it was the visitors who were the first to make a mark on the scoresheet, from their opening short corner of the match. A straight strike took a deflection of Ron Orens stick as he chased out to block, which wrong-footed Dave Monck by the left post, the ball sneaking into a tiny gap.
South responded well to this set-back, continued to play their hockey and were level not long afterwards from their own opening short of the game. Dave Ms clean first-time strike was well saved by the Ely keeper, only for Colin Singleton to react faster than the defence to loose ball, allowing him to sweep home. A few minutes later Colin came mightily close to giving South the lead. Gareth Hebbron went on a meandering run that began on the right wing and ended in the circle in the left channel. A shot didnt seem to be coming until Col picked the ball off Gareths stick with a fizzing undercut that was heading for the top corner of the net until the Ely keeper matched the quality of the shot with an equally good pad save to turn it over the bar.
South seemed to run out of steam in the last ten minutes of the first half. The passing suddenly lacked snap and was getting intercepted easily, and also the defence's marking was beginning to get sloppy. Ely took the lead when they exploited a large hole down South's right flank for a quick counter-attack. The initial shot was well saved by South keeper Lino Di Lorenzo, but with the defence scrambling, Ely regained possession and put another attempt on the net. This looked like being cleared by Dave M on the goalline, only for Ron and Lino to also make desperate attempts to stop it, with the three South players all putting each other off and the ball apologetically finding the backboard.
Within a minute it was 3-1, as Elys pacy right winger went all the way around the outside of the South defence. Once again, Lino and the defenders managed to stop the original penetration but without getting the ball clear of the circle, and another secondary shot found the backboard with the help of a deflection. As if all this wasnt bad enough, the dodgy period continued after the interval, with Elys fourth goal possibly the softest of the lot. A simple ball into the circle found a midfielder who had been allowed to make a twenty yard run forwards completely unmarked, and he had a simple task of scoring past an exposed Lino.
When in possession, South kept pressing managed to keep Ely honest, producing a few scares for the visitors throughout the second period. The closest to adding to the scoresheet was when skipper Kevin Rowland reacted quickest to a loose ball rolling across the circle, but his shot on the stretch was blocked by the keepers pads.
Ely added two further goals from competant short corner routines during the second-half to give the scoreline its final complexion. The margin was a little harsh on South who had competed effectively throughout with an Ely side that play their league games one division higher. However the margin also demonstrated the value of sharp finishing, and of upgrading to shorts when you have a routine that you can rely on. An instructive experience, and a useful workout for the side. Overall a much better performance than last saturday, despite the respective final scores. Bring on the league games!
Skipper Kev's post mathc commet was, ""We matched the level of hockey played by Ely, a league above us, in the first half and the last half of the second, but they took the advantage when we came off the boil. The score line wasn't important at the end of the day, that everyone worked really hard and played well to get back to league hockey pace was. I'm looking forward to the trip to Bourne knowing that the team are ready to restart the league with good hockey and confidence""

The CSouth defence, with Steve Fleck in an unaccustomed sweeper position, supported by the excellent SneadeEvansPassmore, provided an impenetrable barrier enabling those further up field to prosper. Tom South (aged not-a-lot) buzzed away fearlessly up front against physical opponents and got his reward by making the right wing move that led to James Pope's first goal, a typical long range thunderbolt.
More goals were always likely as CSouth enjoyed good possession and used it well, up the middle and on both wings, to get to the danger area. Only two more came in the first half, with skipper John Greaves nutmegging the keeper from a couple of yards out. Greaves turned provider shortly after, selflessly passing back to Paul South at the top of the D from a melee, for South to tonk the ball into goal.
The floodgates opened after half time. Wilco Dijkstra, loitering close to the keeper, neatly place the ball into the corner, and then man of the match James Pope demonstrated how things should be done with a solo dribble ending with another corker. Paul South got his second, taking a knock back from the keeper after a free hit, again from range. Matt Kern, straight off the subs bench, rifled a shot in from a tight angle for the 7th.
By this stage CSouth had worn down the Ely team, who tried to keep going but were out played and outrun, by continued intelligent hockey from the away side. This enabled Greaves to notch up his hattrick, scoring two more goals; one from a Wilco Dijkstra effort which was thinking about not going into goal before Greaves swept it over the line from close range. The final goal was down to good work by the constantly dangerous Rupert Espley who hassled the keeper sufficiently to get a shot in, which Greaves got a reverse stick onto, ensuring it found the net.
Steve Parker, kindly filling in as GK, played well too when called upon to hoof the ball away from the D.
CSouth 3rds made this a convincing victory, kept going throughout, used the width of the pitch, and played as a team. Let's continue in the same vein for the remainder of the league season.

With a scratch team featuring some new players, especially in defence, it was important that South had a chance to settle into the game. However, their visitors didnt allow them this privilege, scoring three times in the opening ten minutes, effectively deciding the result this early. Some reshuffling by skipper James shored things up in the South rearguard, leaving fewer players walking straight through onto Shahbazs goal. However, Letchworths short corner routine was still effective and they added a fourth goal before the interval.
South pushed on in the second half hoping to test Letchworths young goalkeeper, but the final pass kept going astray as the team struggled to establish their pattern of play. In fact, over the entire 70 minutes, despite many incursions into the circle, South wouldnt manage a single shot on target. At the other end Letchworth added two further goals from their efficient short routine to give the scoreline its final of complexion.

Bourne won that game 3-1 but there was never any likelihood that the score would be repeated here as the home side started with such speed and directness that it was 5-0 within 12 minutes.
It should be noted that the Bourne side here was depleted of some of its regular players, but nonetheless South displayed a cutting edge and ruthlessness that would have cut through the best defences in this league. Bourne pulled 2 goals back, but here the fight back ended as South scored twice more before the half time interval.
There was a slight lull in the second half as the home side paused to catch their breath, before a late surge saw 4 more goals scored before the final whistle was blown, whilst Bourne managed to get another back to make it 11-3 at the end. Mark Taylor scored another hat-trick, Chris Baker added 2 to his tally, Chris Graveling scored a brace (including one from a flick), Chris Massey slotted home two late goals and Russell Johnson and Robert Garrett also added their names to the score sheet with a goal apiece.

From the start the goals rained in (sorry), as the home team notched up 5 in the first half. Skipper John Greaves grabbed the first two early in the game, one with a typical poacher's style pouncing on a loose ball close to goal, and a second through the old GreavesLewis short corner routine, with Greaves loitering by the near post after sending the corner out to Andy Lewis to fire back to him for a neat deflection. Paul South then rolled a deceptive effort past a baffled defence for the third; he then turned provider with a shot on to a post that James Cobbe turned in. Wisbech got a goal back from an excellent move ending with an unstoppable deflection, but CSouth didnt let this distract them from further success, this time Rupert Espley getting a deserved goal for all his harrying and fine midfield play with a deft flick just before half time.
After the break the defenders were keen to get in on the act, and the best goal of the game was scored by Andy Lewis, ghosting in at the far post to pick up a pin point accurate Ron Oren cross-field ball for the 6th goal. Although Wisbech were quite dangerous in attack, and had some canny experienced defenders, CSouth were able to turn defence into attack by using the width of the pitch, and varying their moves, helped by the midfield controlling the central area and distributing well. John Greaves provided the assist as he picked up the ball on the penalty spot with his back to goal, and passed it out to Paul South at the top of the D to grab his second of the game. Greaves clinched his second hattrick in two weeks with a reverse stick flick into the far corner soon afterwards.
By this time CSouth were coasting, and Wisbech made them pay by capitalising on sloppy defending to get their second goal, but this was not enough to stop a convincing victory which put CSouth 3rds equal on points to the league leaders with only a goal difference inferior by 1 goal separating them from the top spot.

Spalding quickly spotted that CSHC's defence was able to support the attacking play and put one of their young attackers deep to push the defence back. In one of their rare attacks up to that point, Spalding went 1-0 up via a deflected shot. They quickly got a second from counter attacking play. As the half wore on Spalding had more and more possessions, but CSHC also had their fair share of chances, but a combination of good goal keeping and 'missing the open goal' meant that at the break the score was 2-0.
From the start of the 2nd half, again CSHC started by having more of the possession and even more missed chances, but after about 15 minutes half James Raikes finally put away his 50th chance and scored. As CSHC was looking for an equaliser, Spalding's right winger smashed in a shot that not only surprised CSHC, but also their own players and CSHC was now up against it at 3-1. CSHC kept pressing forward and at times in their enthusiasm, played with 2 right wingers and no left wingers to confuse the opposition. With about 3 minutes to go, the lone striker from Spalding found he had to beat one defender and the keeper and he controlled the ball neatly, twisted and turned and got the 4th goal. CSHC got a late late consolation through a scrambled short corner, finished by Rob Barton. Final result 4-2.
It was a match that didn't feel like a defeat that may well have gone the other way, but on balance, Spalding played more collectively as a team and deserved to edge the result.

With South 2nds once again having started the league programme with a blank weekend (Bournes floodlights are broken, so last Saturdays game was called off), it perhaps wasnt surprising that the side didnt begin with the sort of passing hockey that vice-captain Gareth Hebbron had called for. However, that this malaise lasted longer than the opening few minutes, all match in fact, was disappointing. Fortunately for South, visitors St. Ives seemed just as far from piecing together their game.
With the match relying on individual skill and dribbles, South generally had the upper hand, and went on to force the better chances throughout. In fact, this reporter doesnt recall South keeper Lino Di Lorenzo having to deal with a single shot on target, a testimony to the efficiency of the South rearguard.
South came close to opening the scoring with their first short corner of the match, when Tim Clapps shot pinged back off the St. Ives post, and it was from a set-piece routine that South got the decisive score. Gareth received the injection and slipped right to Rob Barton. Robs shot wasnt the cleanest contact of his career, but sometimes these are the hardest for goalkeepers to save, as the ball went up over the legs of the keeper and then dipped back down again to find the backboard. Samin Ishtiaq made an attempt to steal the goal, swiping at the ball as it went past him by the near post, but missed it totally, meaning the strike stays credited to Rob. Somehow the goal summed up the game!
The second half continued in similar vein, with South players trying to dribble through on their own, usually to be stopped around the 25 yard line, and St. Ives employing similar moves ending in similar ways. South were having trouble clearing their lines from 16 yard hits, with the ball being shifted around in ever tightening spaces and no-one seemingly willing to put a stick through the ball to get it upfield and away. Again, this pattern was repeated at the other end, with South often breaking up St. Ives 16s. One such interception created Souths best second half chance. From the steal and a quick ball into the circle, Rob got a shot off that was saved, but with the ball still in play under the keeper. Samin had to drag it away before trying to lift it over the prone stopper, but couldnt quite get enough elevation allowing the keeper and a defender on the line to smuggle the ball to safety.
The value of a victory to South was summed up by the green card given to South captain Gareth midway through the half. The card wasnt specifically for Gareth, it was in his role as skipper of the side, and was therefore for the entire team, who had been appealing excessively to the match officials. We were on all notice to keep a bit quieter... The last ten minutes of the game were frantic, with the scores so close. However, the quality was no higher in this period than it had been in the previous 60 minutes, neither keeper being tested, and so the match ended with South still in front. A win, but not a game that will live long in anyones memories.
In many ways this game was all about South 2nds, as it clearly demonstrated both the strengths and weaknesses of the side. On the positive side of the ledger, the marking was decent and everyone worked their socks off to harry the St. Ives players and stop them creating chances. On the negative side, there were few passing options for the player in possession, with little movement off the ball and calling, and as a result once again a cutting edge was noticeable by its absence. As Gareth had pointed out before the match, we have the 2nd best defensive record in the division, but also are the 2nd lowest scorers!
Skipper Gareths post-match comment was, As always our defence did an excellent job, ensuring that St. Ives never really threatened our goal mouth. However our performance outside the 25 really highlighted where we need to improve our game. St Ives did a good job at keeping us on the back foot, but we didn't do much to prevent them forcing us back. Fortunately we took advantage of the chances we created on the break, generating short corners, which we were then able to capitalise on.

Unfortunately this was not enough to fire the team up, although 4 quick goals in the first half helped to make it feel a bit too easy. Simon Ta started things off, with his pace always causing problems, as he pounced to score the first. The remaining goals in the first half were all scored from short corners, with James Pope and Paul South producing a couple of serious tonks, and Ta sneaking another. CSouth were dominating play with confident attacking moves splitting the defence, although too often available players were not used, and chances were spurned. March grabbed one back to keep the away team alert.
Shortly after half time James Pope scored another blaster, which was immediately pegged back as some sloppy play let March in to give them a glimmer of hope. Normal service was resumed when Paul South, running his socks off throughout, and a constant threat on the left side put in an angled shot, which John Greaves touched in to Paul's great irritation, as it was steaming towards goal. Simon Ta got his hattrick as another tricky run ended with him flicking deftly past the keeper.
March got another goal, which raised their spirits, and demonstrated to CSouth that complacency can be costly. Luckily Shahbaz Ali was playing a blinder and kept them from really getting in to the game with some timely and effective dives, and one spectacular save.
In truth CSouth could have had many more goals, and their general play deserved it, but some comical misses and not quite accurate enough passes close to goal kept the score down. Nevertheless there was much to be proud of, in terms of teamwork off the ball, commitment to the end, and some lovely moves and scorching goals. Attacking dead ball moves were sound, with every short corner producing a shot, and the midfield constantly breaking forward well.
This was enough to keep CSouth in the promotion hunt, but we will need more clinical finishing and tighter defending to maintain the recent results against stronger teams.

South began the game a pace above March Town for the first 10 minutes, looking for an early goal. This came from club debutant Al Sinclair who skilfully worked around the March defence in the D to take a shot at goal which took a deflection from a defenders stick, a deserved goal for South that had dominated the beginning of the game. March responded by raising their game. This led to what was an end to end game, March were quick on the counter attack with a pacey midfield that were able to work there way into Souths danger zone quickly. Their equaliser came from such a counter attack and a rare drop in concentration from the south defence. A March forward worked his way into the D and crossed from the right to a waiting unmarked forward at the left post, leaving Lino Di Lorenzo totally exposed. An unchallenged slot on to the backboard made it 1-1.
Souths defence picked up the marking in a tighter fashion from there on. Dave Bartram was disciplined and effective in sticking to their captain, insuring that attacks down their right were met with confident defending. On the other side of the park, the ever well timed jab tackles of George Wych constantly dispossessed the March left flank. Dave Monck, was playing as centre back in order to insure a constant presence to block offensive moves down the middle, while Neil Sneade as sweeper was able to move around the zone mopping up. These two really are effective in the middle together. The South defence continued to illustrate why they have been the most effective defence in this league this season.
Souths second goal came once more from Al, causing mayhem in the D. There followed a general milieu of players in the D, however Al saw to it that South went 2-1 up by finding a gap through he players to push the ball over the line. This followed a number of fouls by March where the umpire sensibly let play go on with the advantage.
March's equaliser came from an organised short corner that was pacey and well executed, 2-2. During the half time talk, the message was carry on as we are, without any slips in concentration to give March an opportunity.
Despite feeling unwell, Colin Singleton pushed himself. Quick on the break, as quick to get back and defend. Samin Istiaq and Stuey Creed were using the space intelligently in wide midfield positions, using accurate line passes and runs to insure that the pitch was used extensively. The March defence continued to struggle against an offensive South midfield and forwards. Pip Dickinson consistently made headway through Marchs midfield and defence throughout the game causing them to pull players back, forcing them deep into their own half. On a counter attack he took the ball into the D, wide left, and over committed the keeper, the option was there to go around him, however Rob Barton had clearly seen the opportunity and put himself in the ideal position to receive a pass from Pip, which led to him nonchalantly pushing the ball in at the right post. This is the kind of intelligent cooperation by forwards that ensures goals. 3-2 to South.
At the other end Souths keeper, Lino the Cat, gave an exhibition of how to keep goal on the feet or on the floor. Whilst on the deck at full stretch with March players in the D his clearances were powerful enough to reach the sideline or reach a South player in position to counter attack. Continually frustrating the oppositions forwards efforts at goal, Lino moved quickly into a goal saving position between the posts responding to shots at any height.
With only a short period to hold the game Kev increased the numbers at the back to help keep the score line to Souths advantage, until a calve cramp meant that any running about came to an end. Colin came back onto the field with a wagging tail, despite his dental discomfort, persuaded by the promise of a new pooch pleaser rope chew.
South did not sit back but made concerted efforts to increase the scoreline advantage toward the end of the game. March also pushed forward in an effort to change the situation however were met with a team effort to ensure they did not effect South bringing home the 3 points.
Credit goes to the umpires Ron Oren and Steve Riches who managed a game that was physical at times and exhibited consistency, appropriate player chats and patience at challenging moments throughout the game.
Skipper Kev Rowland was delighted with todays result commenting It was a physically hard game that required tenacity and consistent physical effort for the full 70 minutes. The team gave a performance that illustrated a real determination to win today against good opposition, it feels good to get the result and Im very proud of the guys

The home team had a simple game plan....pack the defence, pick a brilliant goalkeeper, and hassle anything in black....and it almost worked. Fortunately for CSouth, Tim Waller scored an early goal, as he found space by the far post to pick up a loose ball and shoot confidently.
In spite of constant attacks, and short corners (all of which resulted in a shot) there were no further goals. A combination of great saves, some loose shooting, but mostly massed defensive ranks, kept CSouth out, as Messrs Pope, South and Lewis particularly tried to get through.
There was a short period when the away team let standards slip, but this didnt last long. Overall there were many good things, particularly good passing, use of the whole pitch; smart interplay to get through to the D; positioning off the ball; and 100% commitment by all to ensure another victory keeping CSouth 3rds at the top of 6NW.

The first problem of the day, as always, was the journey. Last Saturday, I was north of the arctic circle. At times on the roads north across the fens it felt like I was halfway back there again! The next was the discovery of the lack of a second umpire. With both teams having 12 players, a deal where each side would provide a player to Umpire a half was struck, with Jan Brynjolffssen taking on the job for South, earning the MoM award in the process.
Once the game was underway the hosts pushed straight into the South circle. Tackles were missed as players dived in, and it looked like it might be a long day. However, after the initial shock of the pace and stick skill that Horncastle could bring to bare, Souths defence began to settle into a pattern that at least caused the hosts some problems in cutting through.
Horncastle took the lead around the ten minute mark when an incursion into the D saw Lino having to go to the deck. The ball bounced off a defensive block and back to a forward, who shot at the net from behind Lino but also from a narrow angle. Neil Sneade was on the line, but he couldnt prevent the ball from crossing. South went two goals behind from a clean, powerful strike into the corner from a penalty corner. The set-piece had been awarded for a deliberate foul outside the circle by Gareth Hebbron, a challenge that was poor enough to also draw a green card; however, in a case of mistaken identity it was Neil Sneade who was singled out for punishment!
South were not on the back foot for the entire of the half, and in fact looked quite dangerous when the front three of Dave Stock, Kevin Rowland and Rob Barton combined. One move had Kev in space on the far post screaming for the ball, only for Rob to elect to shoot, a shot which a defender deflected wide for a corner.
With half-time came the return of Jan to the South fold, and a bit of defensive re-organisation. Neil moved up into midfield, with South now having a sub they could utilise. Horncastles stick skills and dribbling had caused the South rearguard problems throughout and it was from this source that their third goal came; a midfielder picked up a loose ball on the twenty-five, went around the outside of a couple of defenders to edge himself into the circle, from where he fired low and hard in at the near post a shot which proved too strong for Lino to stop, despite him getting a foot on it.
Horncastles fourth goal was quite a frustrating one for South, as a lobbed shot from the top of the circle went past Dave Moncks head; Dave was only a couple of yards from the ball, and the South defence felt the shot, as it had been above knee-height of a defender within five yards, ought to have be ruled dangerous. However, the Umpire didnt agree, and with the ball dropping at the goal out of the bright afternoon sun, Lino was only able to glove the ball over his own line.
South were beginning to play some nice passing hockey of their own in this period and were getting closer and closer to breaking the Horncastle rearguard. Eventually, as it had to, it cracked. Neil intercepted a pass on the 25 and shipped the ball left to Dave S. Dave flicked a neat pass into the run of Rob in the right channel, from where Rob found the far corner with a firm (strong-side!) shot. A few minutes later it seemed that South had cut the gap to just two goals when Dave Ms powerful free hit from the left was given a slight deflections in the circle by both Dave S and Gareth before ending up in the goal. However, with the crowd of bodies the Umpires couldnt be sure who it had hit and after consulting each other gave a long corner.
To compound matters, South then conceded a fifth goal with a powerful strike from a switched short corner. Again, Lino got a piece of the ball as it went in, but not enough to save it, in fact dragging it clear of Dave M on the line who insisted he had it covered. Lino might have saved the shot if he had been able to spread himself as he wanted, but on coming out and trying to lie down he discovered post-man Jan in the way, and had to go down late and to his left instead of his preferred stretch to his right.
South had the last words in the game, when Kevin turned a Colin Singleton driven ball goalwards towards the near post. It wasnt the sweetest contact of Kevs career, more a slow bobbler, but it was this aspect of the shot that did for the Horncastle keeper as the ball bounced over his attempted stick save. One final chance for Rob, which went just wide, was the last significant action, as the match finished 5-2. With more luck with the decisions the final score might have been 4-3, but that Horncastle deserved the three points was in little doubt.
Skipper Kev was pleased with how his side had fared against opposition with many quality players, saying Travelling 2+ hours to play the clear league leaders was always going to be hard, the team raised their game to give them a challenge and came away having enjoyed the match, periods of fluid passing play by South led to a good number of chances against a sound Horncastle defence.

Unfortunately this didnt help in the first 10 minutes as Spalding had the best of the play. Luckily the home team held together, and there was little threat of conceding a goal, due to the new DeanFleckRichies defensive combination. Gradually CSouth got the upper hand, confirmed by a sweet opening goal as John Greaves' layoff presented Andy Lewis with the chance to take the lead with a decisive shot after a multi pass move. Spalding equalised against the run of play, as the defenders on the line were unsighted (they said) and couldnt prevent a flick shot going up into the net.
CSouth moved up a gear after half time, and two terrific Rupert Espley goals sealed the match. Although in the first half the (many) short corners all resulted in a shot, these had been blocked. Smarter tactics now led to Andy Lewis slipping the ball across to Espley, to flick deftly over the keeper for his first, and get his second as a well worked Paul South effort cannoned back from the bar for Espley to slot in to the net from a Greaves-esque close range. Paul South got onto the scoresheet himself just before the end, taking a Lewis pass in his stride and shooting firmly into goal from distance.
There were other chances, and the team as whole gelled well, having developed in the last few games, learning to use the whole pitch, pass smartly and early, and support one another - particularly the WallerHarperDijkstra central midfield, although everyone played their role well.

The rest of the game continued to be tight with St Ives gradually getting more and more pressure but unable to convert thanks to some scrabbling defence and good keeping.

They were unable to create any clear-cut chances, however, and the away side comfortably held them at arm's length before hitting two goals in the space of ten minutes. The first came from Mark Taylor after Robert Garret raced through and crossed. The second was a trademark Chris Graveling deflection off a short corner.
Rutland grabbed a slightly fortuitous goal on the stroke of half-time which gave them hope for the second half but a disciplined defensive performance from Cambridge stifled the home side's attacks.

South were on top from the opening whistle, with the ball barely leaving the Nomads half. Half chances were coming and going, but with the ball flying around near the Nomads net so often the breakthrough had to come. South thought they had achieved it when Kevin Rowland poked home after a scramble in the circle. Instants before the ball had gone in however, a Nomads player had tried to clear the ball and only succeeded in lifting it into the chest of Rob Barton. The (Nomads) Umpire initially had tried to play an advantage to South for this, but when he awarded the goal the understandably vociferous protests from his clubmates were enough to encourage him to discuss the situation with the other (South) Umpire, and also both captains. The eventual outcome was a short corner to South, which as your match reporter is a qualified Umpire himself he can confirm was exactly the right decision. It may have taken the Umps a while, but they got there. South, of course, didnt score from this short However, that was but a momentary reprieve for Nomads. And when South took the lead, it including a helping hand, or more specifically foot, from the visitors. A fairly aimless ball had been played into the Nomads circle from distance, which was rolling into the net for a 16-yard hit. However, the keeper strangely elected to kick the ball clear and only played it straight to Dave Stock, waiting on the penalty spot. Dave controlled, didnt panic, and passed the ball into the corner of the net. Souths lead was doubled towards the end of the first half. Dave Monck took a free-hit from the 25 yard line and fired it into a crowd in the circle. The ball took a couple of ricochets before ending up on the stick of Colin Singleton, waiting, unmarked, by the left post. Col had a simple task of rolling the ball from close range into an unguarded net. The second period followed a similar plot to the first. South well on top, Nomads trying to play on the counter but generally getting nowhere near shooting at Steve Parkers goal (Steve wouldnt have a save to make all match). The lead was extended when a shot-cum-cross from Al Sinclair from the right channel was flicked high into the net by a man at the far post. Discussion after the game on this goal was quite confused with both Rob and Dave S convinced they had had the final touch. Both found advocates for their position from teammates. The debate was finally settled by Dave saying Well, Ive got one other goal anyway, so Rob can have this one. The final goal of the match was more clear-cut, and possibly the best that South 2nds have scored all campaign. A battle for the ball in the midfield was won by Jan Brynjolffssen by knocking the ball clear of the tackle area backwards to Al Sinclair. Jan then moved wide to the line, where Al slipped a nice pass between two Nomads to find him. Jan feed the ball on to Samin Ishtiaq further up the flank who drew a defender before passing back inside and square to Al, who was moving up the right channel to support the attack. Right-midfielder Al had the time and space to look and wait on the ball, spotting his opposite flank man Col making a darting run towards the far post. Als 25-yard crossfield pass to Col was superbly directed and weighted, perfectly into his run, allowing Col to finish emphatically with a first time sweep. That wrapped up a comfortable victory for South, keeping them in the top half of the table, comfortable that they are well out of range of the teams at the very bottom, and hopeful of a least maintaining sixth spot or possibly picking off either St. Neots or March Town, currently the two sides above them in the table.

CSHC had already beaten Peterborough 8th 4-0 in the away fixture earlier this season and started the match with plenty of confidence and possession. Despite creating numerous chances in the first 15 minutes, none of the opportunities were particularly clear cut. The pattern of the game developed into CSHC gets the ball down the right, gets it across the goal, it gets cleared or we missed. 20 minutes into the game James Raikes finally put South ahead after some simple passing down the right; a change from the formula of trying to dribble past all the defenders.
The 2nd goal did not come until deep into the second half after a series of long corners and side hits from the right hand side. The goal came from the Stuart Creed-Leo Tomita combination where after half a dozen attempts of trying to dribble past the defenders, the pair opted for the hit-through-the-ring-and-knock-it-in approach, Stuart getting the decisive touch.
The remaining goals also came when South started playing basic hockey. The 3rd was scored by the ever-improving Alex Scally, who found himself in a good position to tap in as the Peterborough defence began to tire. The 4th was scored by Steve Fleck from a short corner rebound, when South finally spotted that there was no one going in at the keeper at our short corners. The 5th was perhaps the most spectacular as Simon Ta made a diagonal run with the ball and crossed it back for Alex to sweep into the roof of the net for his second.

South had started brightly, forcing a string of short corners in the opening few minutes. From one of these Rob Barton thought he had scored, but the whistle had below blown for a further short fractions of a second before the ball had broken free of the keeper to allow his finish. After this positive start, it all began to fall apart for South. Bostons strong central midfield pair were running through virtually unchecked, which, allied with the high line that the hosts front men were playing, saw Souths defence getting pulled around all over the place with a consequent loss of shape.
It was from central mid that the opening goal came. A runner went past three, possibly four South defenders with only seemingly half-hearted attempts at a tackle being put in. He eventually reached the byline by Jon Prices near post, from where he pulled the ball sharply backwards to his (unmarked!) centre-forward, who tapped in easily.
South by now were being restricted to sporadic counter-attacks, but they were handed an undeserved lifeline in the dying minutes of the half after a mistake by the hosts goalkeeper. Dave Monck had fired in a free hit from the 25-yard line that was going to go into the goal without a touch, so therefore would have been a Boston 16-yard hit. However, the keeper appeared unsighted on whether any forwards had played the ball, so elected to make the save All this did was stop it neatly less than a foot out as a gift goal for Colin Singleton, who was lurking with typically predatory extent. Most of Cols goals are from this range.
The half-time teamtalk was along the lines that our passing had been sloppy, our marking terrible, no-one was running off the ball or calling for it, and we were extremely lucky not to be out of the game already. Improvements in the second half were demanded. However, it seems that as well as all the other flaws, our ability to listen had also gone, as the second half performance was even more below par than the first.
Boston retook the lead from a short corner routine early in the second stanza. A powerful initial drive was well saved by Jon Price, but unfortunately only fell to a Boston forward on the edge of the circle. With no-one close he had time to set himself before putting a hard flick into the near corner of Jons net. The cringing attempt to block this shot from the one defender attempting to reduce his space is better glossed over (mainly cos it was me!). Boston could easily have been two goals ahead soon afterwards when a ball into the circle ricocheted around before being turned home by their centre-forward. As in the first half for South, the goal was chalked off as an Umpire had already blown for a short-corner. Even-steven on these decisions, then
South drew themselves level soon after this, as they put together their one piece of proper hockey of the second half. Gareth Hebbron picked up a ball in central midfield and hared down the right channel. With a route into the circle available, Bostons left-back had to step up, allowing Gareth to bypass him with a neat pass to Simon Ta, who had pulled wide. Simon got to the byline and crossed to the far post, where Kevin Rowland was on hand to deflect the ball goalwards, and into the top corner. A sweet goal that belonged with a better overall team performance.
This was but a temporary reprieve as Boston quickly retook the lead. Again it was from a short corner routine, this time the straight strike from the top of the circle going through two South defensive sticks, that only managed to make the ball bobble and did nothing to hinder its forward process. The bobble on the ball was enough to deceive Jon, and we were behind again.
South created little for the remainder of the match, but did have one final chance when they were awarded a short corner in the final play of the game. That this was Souths first short of the second period is indicative of how things had gone, as is the fact that this short, with South outnumbering Boston 10 to 5 in the circle, was cleared without a strike on target being attempted. So Boston took an important and completely merited 3 points in their relegation battle, with South left with the long slog home in a pretty low mood.
If South 2nds want to be challenging for promotion from 5NW next season we simply must play better than we did in this game. Too many individual errors and poor play were evident. Hopefully it can be put down to the 2nds being secure in mid-table with little to play for left this season, but even considering that it wasnt the standard we can attain.

With the rest of their forwards keeping width but staying deep and also with the South defence seemingly intent on pushing up to compress play and help in the attacking, some large gaps in the defensive system were appearing, with centre-back George Wych left especially isolated, one-on-one with the danger man, often twenty or thirty yards from help. Alford exploited this with a long ball game, pinging the ball up to their high forward, hoping that he, with the full width of the pitch to work with and only the unsupported George to beat, could get into the circle and get a shot in. This he did a number of times, and it took some smart work from keeper Steve Parker to preserve Souths early advantage. In fact, said centre-forward was heard to mutter after about twenty minutes We should be 4-1 up!, and while that was an exaggeration he had the semblance of a point.
Having got through this dodgy phase without damage, South then knocked the stuffing out of Alford by doubling their lead. The ball was feed into the circle to Rob Barton. Just like the opening goal, the initial shot was saved, but not cleared. Also, the Alford goalkeeper bumped into one of his defenders, sending both to the floor. Rob picked up the rebound and got a reverse stick shot off before the keeper had had the opportunity to regain his feet. This shot found the target despite the desperate efforts of a defender rushing back.
If a goal has ever changed a game as much as this second effort did, then Ive rarely seen it. From being a distinct threat to the South net, forcing shots and corners, Alford were suddenly unable to penetrate the South 25, never mind the circle. At the other end, Souths team play, which had been so noticeably absent at Boston, was back with a vengeance. Players ran into space, people called for the ball, triangles were being set-up all over the pitch and the Alford defence was being given a thorough workout. That South didnt extend their lead before the interval was down mostly to good goalkeeping, somewhat to chances being snatched when there was more time available.
The second half began with Alford upping their workrate and getting a foothold back into the match. South were still moving the ball around well and creating the better chances, but after the complete lull of the second part of the first half, Parky in goal was back to being more than a mere spectator.
Alfords improved play saw them pull a goal back after around ten minutes of the period. Souths defence had been on the retreat for a couple of minutes, dropping deeper into their own half, inviting pressure that saw them struggling to clear their lines. This eventually led to a scramble at the top of the circle, with two South defenders foregoing the chance to clear the ball when it was on their sticks. Alfords experienced central midfielder took advantage of all the hesitation, thumping a shot as soon as he had any chance of being near the ball, which flew out of the crowd and into the far corner. A prime example of the value of seeing more than two yards ahead of oneself and therefore doing something decisive with the ball, but from a defensive standpoint a really soft goal to concede.
Fortunately this period of play was just an aberration, as the defence reset their line outside the 25 rather than 10 yards from their byline and once again held Alford at arms length. At the other end, the chances continued to come, and the lead was quickly back up to two goals. A move broke down with the ball running free on the Alford 25. Al picked it up, moved towards the right channel, beat two men to get himself to the edge of the circle and fired unstoppably into the far corner.
The next few minutes were all about Al, and when/whether he would get his hattrick. It seemed he had when a goalmouth scramble ended with him turning home from close range, only to discover that a short had been awarded fractions of a second before he found the finish. From the resulting short, the initial shot was saved but the ball was quickly re-gathered by South. It was worked square to Al at left slip, taking the keeper out of the play. With only a defender on the line, Al shotwide! But it was only a matter of time. Tim Clapp picked up a ball in central midfield and passed straight up to Al. A beautiful first touch managed to combine bringing the ball under control and beating the last defender, setting Al clean through one-on-one. The keeper rushed out to meet and spread himself, only to see the ball driven over him and into his goal.
South 2nds showed gentlemanly politeness in the final minutes of the game, as Alford were given the opportunity for the last say. A short corner was given, the shot was true and on target, heading for the bottom corner. A defensive stick got a piece of it, raising it upwards but still goalwards. It would have gone in if it hadnt struck Jans shoulder as he stood in the goalline. The Alford Umpires initial decision was only to award a short, prompting Jan to tell her Its a flick, it hit me on the shoulder and it was going in. Despite teammates (notably Ron) fervent attempts to shut him up, Jan had said enough to convince the Umpires to consult each other, the discussion ending up with the flick being given. The centre-forwards finish was good, the final score of 4-2 had been reached, and the Lemon-of-the-Match voting was a foregone conclusion!
Skipper Kevin Rowland was pleased with the day, saying The team fully turned things around this week after lasts weeks disappointing game. It was positive passing and possession that led to our chances being converted into goals and a good win today, achieved by fluid, decisive and sharp teamwork.

Bourne arrived in Cambridge with a young and skilful side and that was evident from the large amount of possession they had [Editors note  they had also arrived as League leaders, but I felt it was better not to mention that to you guys during the match!]. But (I was told these days you can start a sentence with 'But') despite dominating the play, Bourne did not create many clear-cut chances and it was CSHC who had the better opportunities on the counter-attack. About 20 minutes into the game, one such break was orchestrated by James Pope who found Alex Scally to the right of the Bourne goal with a sublimely weighted and accurate pass. Alex did the pass justice by taking it inside the 'keeper and scoring with a slick reverse stick shot. CSHC's confidence grew and had more possession as the half wore on, but did not produce any more goals. HT 1-0.
The second half was a similar pattern as Bourne pushed forward to try to get an equaliser. Bourne attacked mainly down their right, but David Bridge somehow always managed to disrupt their play and kept them at bay. CSHC found lots of space on the break and Alex could easily have had a second and James R also had a good shot that went narrowly wide. It was a well fought, narrow win cheered on by Vicky Lavis who made so much noise that it felt like we had the whole club there supporting us! (journalistic licence).

The first half saw plenty of opportunities missed by Market Deeping with some creative passing that put South on the back foot. South put in their share of counter-attacks but the score remained 0-0 at half time.
Skipper Kev was not playing due to injury but was able to observe what was happening on the astro. At half time his call was for the same good work ethic to continue but to use this energy toward a passing game to keep possession and create more goal scoring opportunities.
The team responded and the second half saw South with the advantage. The Market Deeping defence were now on the back foot but a goal in open play was frustratingly hard to achieve. It took a well taken South short corner to gain the lead. The ball was struck hard and true by Dave Monck with nothing the Deeping defence could do to stop it.
Both teams created chances after this but the South defence saw off a number of Deeping short corners well with determination and focus. The closing minutes of the game saw South under pressure and led to a nail biting finish.

This only encouraged St Neots to retake the lead from another short corner just before half time.
The best goal of the game was the second CSouth equaliser, which showed that the home team could do short corner routines too. Greaves to Creed to Espley for the latter to flick the ball calmly over the keeper. Espley and Greaves were combining well in attack, but the excellent and robust St Neots defence prevented them from getting too close to goal. The home team had chances, from Paul South, Stuart Creed and the forwards, but it was St Neots who got the winner, from a cross which was turned into goal at shoulder height, surprising everyone around.
CSouth played well, but St Neots had the aces, and a resolute (and once more reshaped) home defence coupled with battling midfield and purposeful attack were not enough to get CSouth 3rds back to winning ways. It seems that other 6NW teams are getting stronger for the run in at the end of the season, and the CSouth lead at the top of the league is down to 2 points, with 2 games to go.

Cambridge started sharply and controlled long periods of play in the first half, but struggled to create any clear-cut openings. They improved as the half wore on, though, and Chris Baker was able to open the scoring after Robert Garrett forged his way into the Wisbech D. Wisbech equalised soon after, however, with an accurate shot from a short corner that slipped in at the right post.
The set-back didn't deter Cambridge, and in the second half they continued to push forwards looking for the goals to reward their slick passing in midfield. This allowed Wisbech to hit Cambridge on the counter-attack and on one of these attacks they forced a short corner, from which they took the lead as the shot bounced over keeper Steve Parker.
Despite creating more opportunities, and getting many short corners, South were unable to find the back of the net and it was Wisbech who were next to score, before Cambridge pulled one back late in the game (again through Chris Baker).

Peterborough pressured South from that start winning the majority of the midfield skirmishes only for their attacks to crash and break against the notoriously stubborn South defence. Marshalled by Neil Sneade, George Wych and Andy Passmore cut out Peterborough's flighty forwards, while Dave Monck eclipsed the top of the D.
South consolidated its defence with midfielders dropping back to help out, and in response to Peterboroughs aggressive formation began using long ball tactics. Dave Moncks 16 yard strikes found Tim Clapp playing high and Samin Ishtiaq wide on the right again and again, resulting in some 1 on 1, and 2 on 2 situations which could have resulted in several goals for the home team.
Peterborough failed to cut out Souths long ball and were soon punished when Al Sinclair from a break managed to force himself through several Peterborough defenders into the D and decisively strike home the ball ten minutes before the half.
This game of Cat and Mouse continued into the second half, with Peterborough being increasingly frustrated by the unbreakable South defence and Souths unstoppable long balls. More break away attacks by South resulted in several opportunities that could have seen the score line widened on a number of occasions were it not for the Peterborough goalkeeper.
Inevitably Souths hard pressed midfield and defence began to flag towards the closing quarter of the game, fortunately goalkeeper Jon Price was able to step up and swat away several very good chances that could have well have been Peterborough equalisers.

However, he was also of a similarly young age to many of his teammates, with a consequent lack of inches, and it was this that was (accidentally) exploited for Souths winner.
Wilco was picked out by a cross at the top of the D; he swept first time and somehow succeeded in launching the ball skywards.

Cambridge South had lost 3 of their previous 4 games as their mid-season form began to stutter but this victory over the team in second place in the league puts them back on course for a top-4 finish.
The game was played at a high level with both sides passing the ball around well, much to the appreciation of the fans on the sidelines. It was a tight game, though, with both defences doing well to keep the opposition at bay. It was the away side that got the breakthrough, scoring from a short corner as the ball was deflected beneath goalkeeper Steve Parker.
The home side were not put off their stride, though, and upped the tempo in the second half as they searched for a way back into the game. That way came from the season's top scorer - Mark Taylor. An excellent first-time strike on the run from Eliot Read's cross put them level, and a neat finish from close range gave them the lead late in the game.
With the home side pushing forward, University were able to break quickly and put pressure on the South defence but despite some good passing moves, they were unable to fashion many clear-cut opportunities.

The day had begun with skipper Kev emphasising the importance of the three points. Apparently they could well mean the difference between 5th and 6th place come the publication of the final table. Certainly, the teams could hardly have been closer in league position at the start, with South ahead by the narrowest possible margin, a +1 better goal difference.
The least said about the opening half the better; it was almost a complete non-event. Midfield stalemate meant that the St. Neots keeper hadnt touched the ball in anger, whilst the sum total of Shahbaz Alis opening 35 minutes between the sticks for the 2nds was to kick away one dangerous ball into the circle, and a dive to save a shot heading into the corner that wouldnt have counted anyway as the whistle had already gone.
Things were a bit livelier in the second period, fortunately. It was South who got the opening goal, a crucial score in a match as tight as this one was proving to be, via a neat variation on the short corner routine. The ball was slipped left to Colin Singleton, who struck cleanly at goal. The Saints keeper may or may not have had it covered, but he was rendered helpless by Tim Clapp adding a deflection to the shot a couple of yards in front of him, the ball zipping beautifully into the top corner of the net.
Having found the goal, South then more or less put the game to bed a minute later. From the push-back the Saints pressed forward into the South circle. However, the move broke down with a free-hit conceded to South, and when Jan Brynjolffssen took this rapidly, the Saints were caught with their defence napping, the simple pass having set Gareth Hebbron and Ron Oren away two-on-one. Gareth drew the last man and slipped it to Ron, powering down the left wing with no-one between him and the byline. All of this had taken place inside Souths half, so the first issue for Ron was getting all the way to the circle without collapsing exhausted. Having achieved this, he pulled the ball inside the Saints left-back, who sprinted back in an attempt to cover, and then slapped a shot just inside the exposed keepers near post.
Souths league form this season has been built on a solid defensive platform. Only champions Horncastle have conceded fewer goals, so with a two-goal cushion things were looking rosy for the visitors. But with time ebbing away, the defence unaccountably switched off. Saints winger Mel Emery made his way to stand next to the post when a free-hit was awarded. South, bizarrely, chose to completely ignore him. The free-hit taker didnt, picking Emery out cleanly, from where a simple deflection saw Souths lead halved.
Saints tried to come again in the remaining time, but with a couple of minutes left on the clock, South again exploited more hesitancy in the home defence to put a seal on the points. A clear foul on a South player on halfway saw the Saints pause, expecting a whistle. However, with the ball in Rob Barton's possession, the Umpires saw no need to stop the match, and when Rob made a simple pass to Tim in the right channel, once again a South player was clean through despite being a whole half away from the St. Neots goal. Tim covered the yards, drew the keeper and fired it over him into the far corner.
Skipper Kevin Rowland was especially happy with the second half performance, saying After and an even first period we raised our standard in the second half which showed the difference between the teams and got a deserved 3 points.

Cambridge South needed to re-jig after a couple of late pull-outs due to illness. Long Sutton started brightly, playing with verve and some fantastically incisive passing. It was clear that some disciplined hockey was needed for South to have a chance of getting past this side.
Long Sutton took the lead early on with a good finish after some sharp interplay. South responded with an assured finish from Russell Johnson after good approach work by Simon Ta. South then produced some excellent hockey to take the lead. A strong ball into the D and a neat deflection by Rupert Espley allowed Andy Lewis to sweep home in true notveryfarfromthegoallineJohnGreavesfashion!.
Long Sutton as expected, exerted real pressure to try and level the score with some very skilful passing. It didnt work. Souths defence was resolute, James Lee having perhaps his best game to date, breaking up play and distributing the ball superbly. The welcome return of Matt Bailey brought some steel to the defensive group and Leo Tomita, answering an eleventh hour call, was simply superb. Ian Evans again had a great game, snuffing out LS attacks and using the ball intelligently. Any lingering hopes of getting something from the game were smashed by Steve Parkers commanding display in goal.
The next goal was Souths. Great interplay between the highly effective Espley and the irrepressible Pope fed the ball to Johnson who struck a fierce shot at goal and Simon Ta was there to bundle the ball home in quite the most awkward manner: time stood still as it finally crossed the goal line.

The St Neots side did get the odd break, but nothing serious until 25 minutes in where a well struck short corner gave them the lead and the more confidence to mount further attacks.
In the second half, it was clear that St Neots wanted to play even more on the break, instead of 1 player 'hanging around further up', they started having 2. CSHC 4ths however equalised early. A short corner shot struck by James Raikes from the top of the D was deflected by James Hodge for his first goal for the club. James H delivered a classical right-wingers performance by going round the defenders numerous times on the outside and occasionally even drifting in.
The remainder of the half was uneventful until a rowdy crowd of CSHC 2nds players turned up in the rain to 'cheer' the 4th team on. Mostly due their support and a very small portion due to James Raikes' tactical nous, CSHC 4th team took the lead. JR not only invited Ian Glover, who played at sweeper to 'come up to attack', but even completely foxed the opposition by varying his short corner routine and passed the ball to Ian G, who swept the ball into the net and made the score 1-2 with only 5 minutes remaining.

Anything other than victory had the potential of dropping the team down a few places, so captain Chris Baker was keen to ensure a professional and disciplined performance. March were third from bottom and without the possibility of moving either up or down the league on the final day, they had only pride to play for. The away side's game plan was undermined before they arrived at the pitch, though, with a number of regulars absent from the team and further complications caused when Chris Massey came down with flu in the morning.
Nonetheless, Cambridge managed to control much of the first half and went in at half time 1-0 up thanks to a Mark Taylor goal. March had threatened occasionally, but were unable to create any clear-cut chances. They started the second half with more determination and urgency, though, sensing the possibility of grabbing a point or more, but a second goal from Mark Taylor 10 minutes into the half should have settled the game.
Unfortunately, Cambridge started to lose their structure - left back Ron Oren having to leave the pitch through injury surely didn't help - and March Town got a goal back midway through the half. Only a few minutes later and they'd equalised when the marking from the Cambridge midfield went AWOL. It was now end-to-end stuff with both sides fighting for the winner. Scares at both ends followed, as defences got jittery.

South had come into the game in strong form and started the match in that fashion, pinning Newmarket back. Skipper Kevin Rowland came close to giving his side the lead when he picked up the ball near the top of the circle and made space for a shot on the turn, only to see the ball just pass wide of the upright. South were causing a major fuss in the Newmarket circle whenever they got there, especially through the stick skills of Al Sinclair, but somehow the scrambles never dropped to a forwards stick.
After the fast start, however, South appeared to relax from the fast tempo game that suits them best into the more considered pace that Newmarket wished to play the game at. With the tempo in their favour, the visitors began to boss the midfield, working the South defence around, though only a couple of direct shots from narrow angles were allowed on Jon Prices net.
Another feature of the first half, and indeed the match, was some decision making from both umpires that surprised both teams. Not that there was any suggestion of bias from either umpiring party; they were fairness personified. In fact, as one of the Newmarket players pointed out, They are both trying so hard to be fair that they are giving everything and anything against their own club!. Unfortunately the behaviour of both sets of players when confronted by this somewhat let themselves down. Umpires are of course human, and can make errors. They give up their time to make sure our games can go ahead, so shouting at them when you feel they have got a decision wrong is a pretty foolish way to act (mea culpa on this one!). Even worse from a playing perspective was that players from both teams were failing to play the whistle, which led to some dangerous defensive situations for both teams as defenders stopped and attackers didnt. South engaging in this prompted an expletive laden half-time rant from their normally laid back and super-positive sweeper Neil Sneade.
Also discussed at half-time was South bringing pace back into their game, which was generally felt to be the method by which Newmarket could be bested. Again, the start was positive, and early in the half South had a great chance to take the lead when Colin Singleton picked out Al up against the last man. Als control of the ball took him clean through, but his driven shot only found the foot of the post and the rebound was cleared away. At the other end, the South backline was doing a generally good job of keeping Newmarket outside the circle. On one of the few occasions when they did penetrate, a rising shot was directed towards the right corner of Jons net which needed an excellent volleyed stick save to keep it out.
The game entered its final quarter with the score still goalless (time as judged by South having made their final planned rolling sub, Kev coming on for Stephen Fleck at holding midfield), when Newmarket took the lead. Last week the South defence switched off when defending a free hit just outside their circle, leaving a player completely unmarked by a post, who promptly scored. They dont seem to have learned from their mistake as Newmarkets goal came from precisely the same route: a player waiting by the back post was picked out by a free-hit, and though he still had a bit to do in controlling the ball and reverse-flicking it over Jons despairing stick, he managed this quite neatly. To quote Benjamin Franklin, The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Maybe the South defence ought to consult their psychiatrists?
In the course of the Newmarket goal, Gareth Hebbron had been clouted on the thumb, which prompted a brief hiatus to the game. Gaz left the field after commenting that It feels all weird, to be replaced at right midfield by Flecky, who had only grabbed the briefest of rests. To quote another well-worn aphorism necessity is the mother of invention. Within two minutes of Newmarkets goal, Flecky, in his new position, had created Souths equaliser. He dribbled down the right and crossed powerfully. The ball deflected off a Newmarket foot on its way across, but the Umpire let the play continue as the ball dropped for Dave Stock to force a sweep shot home (having complained about the Umpiring earlier, it is only right to mention really good pieces of officiating, and this advantage was a perfect example of its kind. It would have been all too easy for the whistle to have already gone for a South short-corner).
With Newmarket having gone ahead and then been pegged back so quickly, all the momentum was with South. One rapid sequence of passing found Dave for a second sweep shot, which struck the outside of the post, before, with five minutes left, some neat interplay on the right between Jan Brynjolffssen, Flecky and Al got the latter to the byline out on the right. Al drove along the base, before pulling the ball back for Dave, arriving in the right channel; Daves third sweep shot in quick succession produced his second goal of the day.
Newmarket tried to press on in the limited remaining time, but Souths backline held them at arms length, before managing to get the ball upfield. With shouts of keep it in the corner, South sucked the remaining seconds from the match to record their fifth win in a row, and eighth from ten games since Christmas (only champions Horncastle have picked up more points since the mid-season break). The victory was also Souths ninth from their eleven home matches (third best in the division), and meant that South have beaten all of the sides in 5NW, bar Horncastle, at least once. With a re-arranged match at Bourne to play next week, South could still finish third in the table, which would represent a very decent return from the season.
Commenting on the game, skipper Kev said ""The first half had me a little concerned but the team showed again how we can respond to what needs to be done, changing the pace and raising the game, to bring home the points. A gratifying win for everyone."" He added ""I was relieved my shorts didn't have a hole in them this week!.

Luckily, the away team took the lead soon after as John Greaves got on to the end of a Stuart Creed cross to sweep the ball goalwards. Wisbech came back into the game, mainly through fast breaks, and were rewarded with a textbook short corner routine that ended in an unstoppable shot from range.
CSouth made tactical changes at half time, which bore fruit as they dominated the second half. The win, and promotion, was assured through further goals from Andy Lewis - a Rob Barton long corner turned on by Simon Ta for Andy L to smash into goal - and Rob Barton. This last goal was made by skipper John Greaves battling with keeper, digging the ball out for Barton to slide it home.
The team played well in all positions, from assertive defending by LeePassmoreEvans cutting out attacks before reaching the danger area, James Pope and his fellow midfielders turning defence into attack and producing numerous probing passes, and the lively attack unfortunate not to score more goals, but getting into good positions and getting shots in.
Celebrations at the end were indicative of a job well done against a sporting and skilful Wisbech team. The league season ends with a second successive promotion for the CSouth 3rd's, now up into Div 5NW for the first time.

South and Bourne had passed all season like ships in the night; they were originally meant to be the first fixture faced, with an opening day game, but Bourne were suffering from early season teething availability troubles and had to forfeit. Then floodlight failure did for the return match in Lincolnshire in January, leaving the one and only meeting of the teams being played on the end of season slip date. As is often the way with such re-arranged matches, especially when no substantive issues are riding on them, the sides were mix-and-match affairs, with some squad members from higher and lower teams being called in to make up numbers. Despite (or possibly because of) this, the game would turn out to be probably the paciest and technically the highest quality of any your correspondent has played in throughout the 5NW season.
South began strongly, and fashioned an early chance when swift interplay from a free-hit saw the ball heading towards Samin Ishtiaq, unmarked by the far post. Unfortunately Samin couldnt get his stick low enough to convert the chance. South continued to probe, also coming close through Mark Taylor and Kevin Rowland, who both flashed shots just wide of target at the end of good passing moves.
If South were controlling the majority of territory and possession, Bourne were looking to the pace and skill of their youngish forward line to create havoc in the South defence. Midway through the first half, a quick counter ended with the hosts taking the lead. The initial thrust into the circle had appeared to be dealt with when keeper Jon Price kicked a loose ball clear. However, two South defenders, who were running back towards their own goal and unaware of each others presence, went to try and collect it and ended up tackling each other. The ball ran free for a Bourne forward, who slipped it under Jon as the South custodian flew off his line to try and rectify the situation.
The first fifteen minutes of the second period then saw the sides exchange four goals. Bourne made it 2-0 when they capitalised on the interception of a South defensive hit to work a player free in the circle. With Jon exposed, he comfortably found the corner of the net. South responded via a set-piece, Mark drilling a short corner into the far corner, with a good clean strike. Bourne again moved two ahead when a pass from deep in midfield found a runner going clean through. He advanced into the circle and again Jon had no chance with a good strike into his far corner. South responded quickly to bring the score to 2-3, Rob Garrett driving along the byline and finding Mark, whose initial shot was half-saved only for him to force home the rebound from essentially on the line.
Despite the lack of any relegation, promotion or championship issues to be settled by the game, the game was not without its relevance. South had begun the day a mere two points ahead of Bourne, so victory for hosts meant a switch of places. South had also started the match with hopes of a victory that would push them up a further place into 3rd, but with time now ebbing away this was now less of a pressing concern than the equaliser needed to retain 4th spot.
Bourne were clearly aware of all of this, because as time ran down they ceded more and more territory to South. Not necessarily the best strategy, as South created a number of chances. Rupert Webb reacted to a loose ball in the circle to stab it past the keeper, only for the ball to drift wide. Mark drilled a short corner that was going just inside the post, until the post-man deflected it out for a long. A free-hit on the edge of the circle picked out Kev unmarked in what in basketball terminology is the high post; Kevs first time sweep was also going just inside the post until the keeper made a marvellous stretching save. Inside the final two minutes, a ball ran free to Samin, coming in from the right wing. His first time drive from close range was well-blocked by the keeper, and when Samins attempt to flick home the rebound was again saved, Souths last chance had gone.
A disappointing result from the final game, as it meant Souths recent winning run had been curtailed at five. The game was also a final competitive match for the 2nds for a couple of players; Gareth Hebbron, who is moving to the USA, where hockey is a strange violent game played on ice, and Dave Stock who isnt going quite as far as he is off to Uni. Another departing regular from this season is Colin Singleton, who has moved to Reading. We wish them all the best in their new locations.
Skipper Kevs summation of the day and the season was We were unlucky not to get the win against Bourne, we looked like the better team, created chances but just couldnt hit the back board. This result does not detract in any way whatsoever from what we have achieved this year, it has been a fantastic season. One which I have enjoyed hugely. Being skipper for the squad is an honour, I am proud of the squad; the hard work, commitment and camaraderie.

Keith and Alex up front were clearly going to combine well with the midfield to create chances, as did James when he came on half way through the first 35.
Once the game had settled it was evident that Nomads, who had fielded their customary blend of skilled, experienced players and equally skilled, energetic youngsters, were going to be tough opposition. However their attacking moves had neither real pace, nor genuine creativity and the experienced South back four, guest starring an imperious Mike at left back, were adequate in their defensive manoeuvres.
At times, when more than 50% of the South midfield four paid attention to their marking at the same time, it was even quite comfortable. When play was broken down in the middle of the pitch, catching an advancing Nomads team on the retreat, big gaps opened up for the wide men, Jorge and Eliot, to run through and link with the strikers. Only once or twice in the first half did Nomads break the line to try and worry Shahbaz but there was little in the way of end product. The final minutes of the first half saw Nomads' best chance of the game go wide of the post but by then South had already scored the two goals that would ultimately win them the game.
For the first, Mike pirouetted into the Nomads' circle to win a short corner and Chris's shot was deflected into the top of the net by the diving keeper. The second came from open play as Chris and Matt danced through the middle of the pitch to open up space down what was almost certainly either the left or the right, for good wide play from somebody or other to open space up for Keith to finish. Another goal for our overseas player.
The second half was a scrappier affair as both teams started to show signs of tiredness. Jorge came closest to making it three for the visitors but his shot went inches wide of the post. Nomads threatened sporadically but not in significant enough numbers to expose the increasingly tired marking in midfield. Good distribution from Mike and Rupert meant that South were generally able to keen Nomads' midfield pinned back.
As the fitness improves this season there are going to be few teams in Div 3NW that can keep a clean sheet against an effective South attack. If they can concentrate on defending as a ten man outfield unit more good wins like this will surely come.","Men's 1sts v  : Awaiting Result","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Missing two key players from the defence, South debutant Nick Bristowe, Ian Evans and Simon Harper travelled with the squad to play in what were perfect hockey conditions.
The first ten minutes saw South dominate the possession with some good passing and movement, with Spalding showing their keenness to try and dispossess players with the ball. When South's passing seemed to falter, they paid the price as Spalding were allowed to effect good tackles and go on the offensive, leading to a cleanly hit shot finding the back of South's goal past the left post.
Loose man marking in the first half allowed Spalding to continue to threaten South's goal, which led to a free man undercutting with his reverse stick beyond the reach of an outstretched Lino. 2-0 down.
Chances for South included a cleanly hit shot from Kev just inside the D, which flashed across the goal and firmly found the left post. Spalding's keeper stopped a Dave Aston flick and promptly got up to stop another quickly taken flick, denying South a goal.
The half time talk pointed out that South were holding on to the ball for too long, with a notable lack of calling for the ball. A call for team work through calling, passing and movement [Ed. - our three secret weapons] was a theme the team took into the second half. This led to increased pressure around the opposition's D testing Spalding's defence, which stood up well.
The second half was a much more even affair overall. With Spalding clearing the ball out of their D when under threat and creating quick counter attacks, play was increasingly end-to-end.
During one of South's attacks, a ball from Dave Aston was knocked by a Spalding player off his keeper into the goal, an fortuitous goal but one that was deserved by South given the pressure they had been exerting. Another goal from South was definitely possible, however Spalding, in a Chelsea-type fashion, seemed to be aware of how to settle for the score line.
Although a friendly it was, it was important for South to be competitive given they were playing a team that competes in a league where the 2nd XI need to be playing next season. Competitive they were and with work on fluid team play through passing and moving, the team's prospects are encouraging. Although the 2nds lost today, the score line was representative of the team's ability to respond and raise their game.
Captain Kev Rowland commented, ""No one could fault the hard work and effort put into todays game by every team member. Every man knew we could have come away with a draw or a win today, we just need to focus that motivation into a game of possession and effective passing throughout the 70 minutes. That is how South will dominate their opposition. Great work gents.""","Men's 2nds v  : Awaiting Result","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

After going 2-0 up South surrendered the advantage and went into the break 3-2 down. A rally at the start of the second half brought them level, before the home side scored a fourth. Five minutes from the end though, the dogged persistance of South paid off as they got a deserved equaliser.
The recent settled weather continued yesterday as Cambridge South Men's 1st XI took on Bishop's Stortford Men's 3rd XI under glorious blue skies and a warm sun. The pitch matched the weather - a new sand-based astro that bore little resemblance to the pot-holed green of the Abbey. And when the match started Cambridge looked sharp and bright, dominating possession and going 2-0 up within 20 minutes. New signing Duncan was playing in the holding midfield role and was dictating play in the middle of the park. Some quick thinking on free hits outside the Stortford D created chances that flashed just wide of the post. Up front Keith and Jorge were creating space well but it was turning into one of those days for the strikers. A typical Baker surge took him past 3 defenders and into the D but the shot fizzed narrowly wide.
After 17 minutes the captain made some changes, bringing on Alex and Matt and the effect was immediate. Rich, Rob and Alex worked a long corner well and enabled Alex to drive into the D along the base-line. Jorge was unable to capitalise on the cross but after some ricochets the ball fell back to Alex and he scrambled it in. Soon after the lead was doubled as the mis-firing short corner routine finally came good - Chris Baker drilling the ball into the net via a deflection from a defender's stick.
At this point it was all South with Bishop's Stortford struggling to gain any possession in our half. Some excellent running by Keith up-front gave the home defence little time on the ball and the harrying forced them into frequent mistakes. Against the run of play, though, they managed to get back into the game from their second short-corner of the game. The strike from the top of the D was going wide but a deflection from Rich's stick put it in the back of the net. The goal gave the home side a boost and as they started to find their rhythm they had a slice of luck to get an equaliser. The ball inadvertently kicked in by a Stortford attacker; unfortunately the umpire didn't see it and so it was 2-2. And a miserable end to the half was complete when South conceded a third goal, this time a fast break by the home side saw them overwhelm the defence and almost pass the ball into the net.
South came out fighting in the second half, knowing that they didn't deserve to be losing. After creating a large number of chances at the beginning of the game they just needed a bit more luck in front of goal but for Keith, it just wasn't his day. After being picked out in the D he was forced wide by the keeper but he kept his cool to turn and lift a shot at goal but it cannoned off the cross-bar and out. The equaliser came instead from another short-corner, this time Jorge planting the ball neatly in the corner of the goal.
The 3 goals had given Stortford renewed hope, though, and they promptly stepped up and started to put the South defence under more sustained pressure. The hot weather was starting to have its toll and it seemed to affect the away side more, but some quick counter-attacking hockey meant that they always looked like scoring another. Unfortunately it was Stortford that grabbed the next goal - a strike from the edge of the D was parried by Lino but he could only look on in anguish as it landed next to the post and spun into the goal.
With five minutes remaining South managed to score again to get a more than deserved equaliser - Rob picking up the ball on the half-way line and running past the Stortford defence before sliding the ball beneath the on-rushing 'keeper.
South will look back on this game and rue the missed opportunities in front of goal, and with 2 of the home sides goals somewhat fortunate to have gone in they'll know that on another day it could have been 4-0 at half time and a much easier game.

From the start it was clear that Cambridge South 2nd XI had the beating of the opposition and it only took a few minutes to convert early possession into a goal. Skilful work from Al Sinclair led to a short corner, the initial shot was blocked by the home keeper but our very own fox in the box, Rob Barton, was on hand to tuck in the rebound.

At this point it looked like the defence were going to have very little work as all the play was in the Stortford half but the game was turned on its head in the space of 10 minutes as the home team converted 2 shorts in quick succession. The first was a clean strike to find the left hand corner with no-one on the post; this was closely followed by another good strike kept out by a miraculous stop by Lino diving to his right but the ball fell loose and a Stortford striker was on hand to fire it into the top corner via John Benedikz's despairing stick.

Finally South's defence found some voice and, with direction from the excellent Nick Bristowe, marking was tightened up and normal service resumed. Matt Kern was tireless in providing probing runs up the left and sprinting back to cover whilst all the opposition's attacks up their left foundered on the rock of JBs defence.

This solid base allowed the midfield to flourish again and the equaliser for South was a peach. A flowing move up the right involving pretty much every member of the midfield was played in across the D by Al Sinclair and MoM (yet again!) Mark Pears swept the ball past the stranded keeper.

Two-all at half time and reinforcements (and oranges) arrived in the shape of LoM Neil Sneade (fresh from Addenbrokes after the arrival of baby Alicia the day before  congratulations Neil!).

Thus refreshed, South then put the opposition to the sword in the 2nd half and the final scoreline did not reflect the true balance of the match. A third goal came shortly after the restart; Jack Chalk made a strong run to the byeline and teed up Mark Pears to sweep home from an acute angle. 3-2 then became 4-2 when good work by Tim Clapp and Dave Aston created hysteria in the Stortford defence. In a melee of swings and misses Rob Barton was again in the right place to knock the ball into the right hand corner.

Into the last quarter of the match and South's superior fitness and skills were showing  Stortford could not find an answer. Time and again the South midfield asked questions of the home defence and, with 10 minutes left on the clock, a 5th goal was added. Rapid interplay between Dave, Tim and George Wych (in unknown territory over the halfway line) created an opening for Rob to run onto. Ghosting past the first defenderonly the keeper to beat, and in a flash Rob was round him with the goal at his mercy. Time stood still as the whole team waited for the sound of ball against backboard but still Rob didn't pull the trigger. Finally the shot was taken, only to strike the foot of the covering defender  penalty flick! With 2 strikers on a hat trick captain Kev Rowland selflessly decided to take the flick himself (thereby saving anyone the expense of a jug) and a few seconds later the ball was bulging the top corner of the Stortford net  5-2 to South.

The final few minutes were played out in festival style and, even though Stortford got a late consolation goal it was not enough to put any pressure on the away side.

After the game, captain Kev Rowland said ""This was our last friendly game and we needed to show we could win games through playing as unit, possession being the key. The team created some excellent passing and plays which led to goals, the scoreline could have been larger but importantly it was the way we played that created the opportunities.

The same number 9 grabbed two early second half goals with solo efforts which came from a superior level of hockey with which we are not familiar. The South response was a Greaves brace, one from a rebound off the keeper after a Creed effort, and the other after the excellent Rupert Espley wriggled down the right wing and crossed expertly to the back of the D for the skipper to control and smash into the net from an angle. Stu Creed got his second shortly after with a rasper from long range to take the lead. The skipper also rattled the backboard on two other occasions but the whistle intervened. By this time South were on top and using the space well, making the ball do the work, and attacking from different angles.

Wisbech, traditionally awkward opponents but perhaps weakened by the departure of key striker Jody Betts, soon found themselves chasing shadows in midfield as skipper Chris Baker smoothly spread the ball to left and right, making space for league newcomer Duncan Rudge to place a savvy aerial and the feisty Lukas Snetler to attack the D with intent.
There were several excellent chances for South in the opening quarter. First, Rupert Webb, making good ground, had a shot blocked and saw the ball cleared off the line with the keeper grounded; then Rudge's well-weighted cross led to a melee in the goalmouth and a desperate clearance; moments later, Snetler was left free at the top of the circle and wound up with eye-bulging ferocity, only to see the keeper parry a fierce lifting drive. Two South shorts also came and went, sandwiching a good pad save from a Keith Hewitt snapshot which led to another furious bout of hacking around the penalty spot. In this time, Wisbech had only breached the South 25 twice, Jim Thorpe calmly breaking up a dangerous thrust up the right wing and Chris Graveling expertly pickpocketing a man on the breakaway.
At this point, Wisbech, having repeatedly been forced to cede possession, dropped back and got more men behind the ball and, though South continued to play neat triangles on both wings, spurred by Rob Garrett's tireless running and Baker's unfussy distribution, the momentum shifted slightly despite a fine surging counter-attack from the evergreen Mike Thorogood and a near-miss past the left post from Alex Pooles. Wisbech gained their first short after 28 minutes, sending wide a firmly-struck drive at an awkward height, and, after surviving a further game of pinball in their own D, they capitalised on a rare defensive lapse by the away side to knock the ball home marginally before several South defenders ended up in the back of the net with it.
Chris Massey, put through by skilful interpassing from Rudge and Garrett, aimed to redress the balance immediately but was beaten away, after which the South defence, temporarily sicklied oer by the pale cast of thought, wobbled at the edge of the D, leaving keeper Steve Parker to rescue a tricky situation with a fine diving block to thwart the man suddenly running free. As the first half drew to a close, South got delayed reward for their earlier domination when Hewitt, showing admirable persistence up the middle, rounded two Wisbech defenders, as well as appearing to tackle himself twice, and created a handy rebound which Alex Pooles was on hand to put away.
Four minutes into the second half, however, South again found themselves behind when they failed to clear after Parker had made a good save from a stinging Wisbech short. Further disaster was narrowly avoided, firstly when a giveaway which left the South goal exposed went unpunished and then again a minute later when Parker twice blanked a Wisbech forward who had burst clear on goal. The home side turned up the volume control at this stage and, with their two young strikers using their pace to worrying effect down the right, South continued to be in danger despite some promising link-ups between Alex Pooles and the much-travelled Matt Readman, a welcome returnee after spells at Walden and Nomads. Wisbech's fourth short, on 47 minutes, was charged down by the defence and then Snetler bravely dived to counter a hit just outside the D. Though Wisbech were growing in confidence, South still tried to use width to make inroads, with Thorogood and Massey combining well to release Massey for a quick shot which was intercepted by the keeper. A key moment came on 54 minutes, when Parker glanced away a well-angled Wisbech short through deft use of stick, gloves and an increasingly influential helmet.
South continued to work grimly for possession, seeing a glimmer of hope when Hewitt rounded the right-back and the determined Rudge had a shot saved, and it was Hewitt who finally got South back on track in the 63rd minute when, with the keeper down, he made the most of a pass artfully funnelled through from the left by Snetler. Spurred on by this success and some forthright ""advice"" from captain Baker, South harried the Wisbech defence and the tireless Hewitt, forcing a turnover, worked a superb give-and-go with Readman, who returned the favour so that Hewitt was able to coolly slot the ball under the despairing keeper with three minutes to go.
There was still time for Webb and Snetler to put together another attack up the right and for Thorogood to put the ball in suspended animation with a neat aerial, and still time, too, for a moment of near-madness when a harmless-looking back pass nearly ended up on the grateful stick of a Wisbech sniper, but - to the audible relief of the assembled travelling support (est. 3) - the whistle eventually blew to confirm the desired start to the League campaign.
Despite failing to convert early dominance into goals and all but going 3-1 down, South held their nerve well and, by scoring twice in the last 10 minutes to come from behind, demonstrated the character and persistence which will be important in the coming months. Excellent two-way performances from, in particular, Hewitt, Garrett and Thorogood, exemplified the hard work that will be needed in both halves of the field if South are to build on the solid progress made in the last two years. If they can combine the fluency of the first fifteen minutes with the urgency of the last fifteen and sustain both for the full seventy, there is room for optimism.

The first league match of the season saw South take on a Wisbech team which had come down from Div 4NW last season and so were likely to provide a good contest. The opposition arrived late (a few minutes before push back they had only one player, forlornly warming up on his own) and had little time to prepare for the game. Not so South who were inspired by a twenty minute pre-match address from Captain Kev ""Maximus Decimus Meridius"" Rowland. The stirring sentiments of Kev's address were offset only a little by the sight of him absent-mindedly stroking Mark Pears's leg whilst speaking!
Once the match started South were out of the blocks strongly and took most of the possession from the outset. Wisbech were young and fleet of foot but the Home side looked to have the more skilled players and three points looked a distinct possibility. However, as the half wore on South found it more and more difficult to fashion any shooting opportunities. The midfield were working hard  in particular Dave Aston and Nick Bristowe were winning everything in midfield and Russell Johnson was a livewire up the right hand side, always making himself available  but the pass and move game that we pride ourselves on was lacking. Time and again a player ran himself into trouble rather than make an easy pass to work the ball around the opposition. In fairness, much of this was due to the Wisbech defence which was well organised and kept the marking very tight.
Despite this, the territorial advantage being won by South meant that they were still the favourites but as the defence pushed up the field to create an extra man Wisbech hit back with a classic counter-attack. A long ball hit out of defence eluded three South sticks and Lino was left with little chance and could only turn and pick the ball out of the goal with practically his first action of the day.
The half continued in the same pattern  significant advantage to South in terms of possession and territory but no end product to show for it. In the last ten minutes four short corners were won but not one resulted in a shot on goal.
On to the second half and South did not let their heads drop. Again they won a series of shorts and finally one paid off, albeit in scrappy fashion. A good injection from Ron Oren was stopped and set up for a Dave Monck special. The mighty Monckosaurus took a huge swing and scuffed the shot in the vague direction of goal. This had the effect of wrong-footing the Wisbech defence and, after a melee around the left hand post, Ron Oren just managed to get a stick on the ball and it dribbled over the line.
The game opened out in the final twenty minutes as the heat took its toll on players and Wisbech created several more breakaway chances, but resolute defence from the back four and some blinding saves from Lino kept it at 1-1 at the final whistle.
So no change from last season for South 2nd XI  a tight defence allowing the opposition only rare sights at goal but the team in general just lacking the vision to create the final pass in the opposition's D. Although 1-1 was a fair result, South can be disappointed that they couldn't convert possession and territory into goals.
After the game captain Kev Rowland said ""It was good to get a point from the first game of the season however I feel we could have got three. The guys worked hard in the heat, it's that effort we need to use to focus on decisive passing and moving. Next week's game is a 'must win' and we will need to play good possession hockey to make sure that happens.""

The late arrival of the entire South forward line didnt help much either.
Pelicans scored two good goals shortly after half time to make the game safe, although one of the goals was an unlucky (if well taken) own goal. Pelicans had most of the pressure, through the simple approach of evading markers, and thus getting players into space with time to place the ball at will.
South didnt give up, with newcomer Toby Bull and Andy Lewis causing frequent trouble, but the away team were unable to get enough shots on target as a result. The consolation came from the old Greaves-Lewis short corner routine, with Andy Lewis unleashing a corker in to the net, to make the score 3-1.
A very slow pitch and the style of the oppostion forced South to pass more than usual, and when we did it paid dividends with many good moves.
This game was of course carefully played to lull the awaiting 2nds into a false sense of complacency. Or at least that's our story.

South started the brighter in the first half and the whole half went by without a single short corner being conceded. South edged the first half, but could not convert the dominance into goals.
A couple of minutes into the second half, Dom Nelson weaved past a couple of defenders and found himself unchallenged and duly put South 1-0 up. A few minutes later, a run from Dave Aston down the left went past two or three Ely players and then crossed the ball to Rob Barton who, with the goal keeper anticipating the trade mark reverse shot, completely fooled the keeper by simply tapping it past the keeper's right using his strong side. 2-0.
Ely's back men then started coming into the attack and tried to get back into the game. Although not under pressure, South's inexperience told as Ely managed to scramble a goal back. Even though they had a man sin binned, Ely managed to win a penalty from a short corner which they scored in the top corner.
With the score at 2-2, both sides tried to win the game. James Raikes managed to hit the post but it was Ely who snatched a late scrambled goal in the dying seconds.

600,"04/10/2008","League",1,114,"TBC",8,"Home","5","3","4","2","False","False","False","In a pulsating game studded with big scoring chances at both ends, South finally emerged triumphant after surviving a determined second-half onslaught from a Spalding side still looking for their first win in Division 3NW.
Such a close-fought outcome seemed unlikely after a twenty-five minute opening spell in which South played what captain Chris Baker judged to be some of their finest hockey ever. Spalding, relegated twice in the last two seasons, were under the cosh from the very first minute when Rob Garrett, racing through on one of his many tantalising breaks, forced the visiting keeper to put his body on the line right at the edge of the circle. A flowing five man move from left back was followed by a neat, swift interplay between Keith Hewitt and a hungry-looking Lukas Snetler and it was Snetler's aggressive thrust forward that led to Souths first short corner, parabolically despatched by Baker via some part of the Spalding rearguard to give South the early lead.
Spalding looked to hit back quickly but, just when one of their pacy strikers appeared to be away, Chris Graveling consummately filched the ball from him and slid a pass to Garrett, who delivered a precision cross for Keith Hewitt to rifle in a classic turnover goal after nine minutes. Moments later, Garrett put in a deft three point turn and motored across the circle, slipping the ball just wide with the keeper in no-man's land.
Undaunted, Spalding counter-attacked, creating a golden scoring opportunity which Steve Parker in goal diverted away with an excellent split-second pad save. Spalding's first short corner, a hard, low drive, was swept clear by Graveling after the block by Parker.
South resumed their authoritative passing game, with Mike Thorogood, playing an assured role further back than last season, combining well with the busy Chris Massey to feed Hewitt and Baker. A beautiful take in midfield by Rupert Webb, whose positioning and thoughtful close passing work were features throughout, led to goal attempts by Snetler and Baker, both saved, and, after Matt Readman had displayed his prowess at the reverse-stick tackle, Baker held off a challenge in midfield to feed Snetler. With the next move, Snetler, Hewitt and Garrett sliced through the Spalding defence and Garrett gave Russell Johnson, bursting forward, the perfect cross for a clinical finish with the keeper relentlessly drawn out and beaten.
The game remained open, however, and, though South created numerous further chances (and Hewitt became the latest neophyte to be tricked by the bewildering number of sidelines at the Abbey), Spalding refused to throw in the towel. They gained just the luck they needed when, from their second short after thirty-two minutes, they pulled one back through a pair of bizarre deflections which left the scorer clutching his head in either agony or disbelief, or possibly both.
Seizing the moment, they attacked once more from the right and the ball again cannoned against the backboard as Parker was unsighted. But South mustered late resolve, with Hewitt setting Garrett up for a near-miss as he cleverly slipped the ball over the advancing keeper and then forcing a short as the ball got stuck near the penalty spot. Using one of the well-tried variations, Baker and Garrett executed perfectly, leaving Baker to shoot in low via the keeper's jersey to create a two-goal advantage which was nevertheless threatened in the dying moments of the first half when a lone Spalding striker tried an angled deflection which Parker, flying to his right, athletically sticked wide.
The second stanza began in similar all-action style, with the visiting keeper denying Snetler with an extended stick after a fine move authored by Readman and Jim Thorpe. Despite tenacious forechecking by Snetler and Hewitt, Spalding broke away to outpace the defence but were thwarted just inside the D by a diving Parker, who then gloved away a rising hit after a further Spalding short had narrowly failed.
As Spalding made space up the right, Thorpe was repeatedly called upon to deliver several of his magisterially calm clearances, whilst Readman hoovered up spare men and skipper Baker, predatory as ever, tried to seize the initiative in midfield. A fast approach by Garrett up the Spalding right was followed by a textbook pull-back cross which went unconverted, but South were forced increasingly on to the back foot as the visitors drove forward in numbers. A heavy drag-flick from their fifth short hit the bar and the rebound looked destined for the net until Parker miraculously found a way to cover with his left foot and then block-and-tackle the ball to safety.
It was all hands to the pump again as Parker made another triple save and Thorpe and Graveling briefly relieved the pressure with cool tackling and blasts upfield; moments later, the keeper's glove took another hammering, Massey cleared with some nerve across the face of his own goal and a sixth short, again a flick, was batted spectacularly away to the right. After this sustained pressure, something was bound to give and, following another dangerous slipped short, Spalding got their reward when a raking run to the right led to the perfect square-back and an easy lift-in while the massed South ranks were outpaced and outmanoeuvred.
At 4-3 with five minutes to go, it was anybody's game but, with the South defence keeping their heads and Readman and Massey working anxiety-soothing triangles, enough breathing-space was found for a counter-attack which resulted in skipper Baker slipping the ball under the visiting keeper's armpit for the insurance marker. South then put everybody behind the ball and a real elevan man effort saw the game out, with Johnson working hard in left defence, Webb straight-driving a boundary into the far corner and Readman conjuring a great reverse interception before, in the last action, Hewitt narrowly failed to convert a pass from Baker.
Skipper Baker was understandably pleased with the team's performance and it was much to South's credit that they were able to weather the storm from a determined Spalding outfit who were never prepared to say die and whose short corner routines in particular always looked dangerous. This was an excellent all-round effort in which, despite being severely tested on occasions, South's experience and resolution came through with all boxes ticked.

CSHC 4ths started brightly enough and for the first five minutes, the opposition looked very beatable. However, they started warming up soon after that. The same story repeated itself three times in the first half, leading to a half time score of 3-0 as the inability to get the ball away cleanly from sixteen yard hits lead to each of the goals. Rutland did have rather a lot of the possession and did try a few times to score with lifting flick shots. Phil Le Gouais did well to keep the score respectable for the second half.
CSHC 4ths came out in the second half looking more organised and held out well against attack after attack. The fourth goal was a very skilful flick into the keeper's top left corner and the fifth goal was another flick high into the goal. James Raikes came back to help in defence, but his only reward was one of the high flick attempts hitting his chest. The pain was compounded by being told off by the umpire for complaining about it being dangerous.
The Rutland team had quite a number of players that can easily play a couple of divisions higher and, despite the scoreline, the team played well against very good opposition.

Benefiting from an extended warm-up owing to the late arrival of the umpires, South immediately took the initiative and, after a fluid series of moves involving virtually the whole team, skipper Chris Baker set Eliot Read up for a reverse lift-in to make it 1-0 with just a minute on the clock, all before Bourne had managed to make any sort of meaningful intervention. The advantage was doubled three minutes later when Baker, after a fine run by the hard-working Lukas Snetler, found the ball sitting up invitingly near the penalty spot and pushed it into the unguarded net without further ado.
August Strindberg 	
Bourne, led by a wily and experienced campaigner who bears an astonishing resemblance to the great Swedish dramatist August Strindberg [Ed. - one of the more obscure references to grace a South match report!] (and who has probably played more East League games than Strindberg had hot smorgasbords), tried hard to find some shape to counter South's heads-up passing game but it was not until the twelfth minute that they made their first foray of note anywhere near the danger area and, even then, they were quickly shepherded away by a persuasive Chris Graveling. Bournes supply lines were repeatedly cut off by astute interceptions from, among others, Matt Readman and Richard Morgan, and it was a struggle for the home side to replicate South's organised triangles and imaginative running off the ball.
The hosts' keeper, already beginning to look overworked, saw James Cobbe ping a shot back off the post after 23 minutes but could only look on helplessly a minute later as Rob Garrett's inch-perfect pass from Baker's short-corner slip found Graveling unmarked at the far post and in no mood to show the backboard any mercy. The final goal of the half arrived when Garrett, a constant menace to the beleaguered Bourne defence, crossed from the right to leave Russell Johnson making the most of a rebound that broke free close in. By the thirtieth minute, South keeper Steve Parker  so busy throughout against Spalding last week  had made the last of his three contributions to this game, diving to bring off an excellent close-range save after Bourne had taken advantage of temporary discomfiture in the visitors' D. The action quickly reverted to the other end, with the Bourne goal perpetually under siege and their defence looking constrained and short of space.
The pressure was soon on again in the second half, as an aggressive Jim Thorpe drove upfield with a telling glint in his eye, but it was Baker who got himself on the scoresheet again after thirty-seven minutes with a firm drive from South's fifth short. Snetler, given good service from a midfield and back division in which Rupert Webb again gave a polished performance, posed a continuous threat with his terrier-like runs and was unlucky to be denied when the home keeper stretched out a telescopic left leg to stop a goal-bound strike on 44 minutes. However, persistence brought its reward five minutes later when, following calm tackling and distribution from Graveling, Snetler buzzed waspishly around the left defence and remained in the epicentre after a prolonged melee in front of the keeper to pop in South's sixth of the afternoon.
A further three short corners proved fruitless as the newly-laid pitch seemed to take the pace off the injection but number ten resulted in a crisp carbon-copy of number three as Graveling finished off a four-man move of horological precision. Despite sterling work from the Bourne keeper, who put up a gutsy show against heavy odds, South still had time to rattle in two more markers on 66 and 67 minutes, the first through Johnson, who rammed in a tumbling rebound with scant regard for his own safety, and the second from a jubilant Mike Thorogood, who cleverly batted in a ball going across the face of the goal. Thorpe, faced with a double chance of glory to bring up double figures, drew a double save at the death, leaving South comprehensive winners over a nevertheless gracious and sporting Bourne side who ultimately failed to manufacture any hint of a conspiracy.
Skipper Baker, delighted that the precipitous rate of attrition affecting the practice balls had at last miraculously been halted, praised the South effort, citing extra fitness as a major factor in the teams convincing start. Early, incisive movement of the ball, good marking and composure in defence were the hallmarks against Bourne and, though a number of clear attacking chances went unconverted, it was good to see South crowding the D hungry for the rebound and not afraid to get their noses dirty in a pile-up. Nine points from three games is the perfect opening but South's next three fixtures, against March, Ely and Peterborough, will be the litmus test of their ambitions and expectations for the rest of the season.

607,"18/10/2008","League",2,122,"",7,"Away","2","2","0","0","False","False","False","The Ivo Outdoor Centre witnessed a see-saw contest between two well-matched teams with momentum gradually building towards a frantic climax.
Despite a late withdrawal by Ron Oren (sore thumb and blisters; it's not clear if the two were linked), necessitating a call up for Johnny Benedikz, and with Neil Sneade also less than 100% (cold), South were confident they could still take a result from the game. However, when the match did get under way South initially struggled against an insurgent St Ives side and were finding it hard to settle into their rhythm, thanks in no small part to smart, pressing play from St Ives.
In what was generally a well-tempered game, it was a surprise when a green card for repeated stick tackling was produced for South within the first five minutes. Worse was to follow when, South having already been warned for a substitute entering the pitch before the departing player had left, a repeat infringement saw Dave Aston yellow-carded into the sin bin. Down to ten men, South battened down the shutters for the remainder of the half, relying on the speed and trickery of Mark Pears up front to keep the St Ives defence honest on the break.
After some gentle half-time arse-kicking from captain Kev, South came out with renewed determination. With eleven men back on the pitch, South started to venture towards the opposition's D again. Despite this, it was St Ives who opened the scoring with a smartly taken goal. The ball was hit right to left from the top of the D through a crowd of players for the left winger to deflect it in from just outside the far post.
Stung, South regrouped and pushed forward. On the wings, Tim Clapp on the right and Patrick Farmbrough, in his first league game for South on the left, were causing all sorts of problems for the St Ives defence. Arsenal was continuing to cause havoc up front and Villa seemed determined to make up for his enforced ten minutes of idleness at the end of the first half by running twice as hard in the second.
With the play increasingly shifting into St Ives's twenty-five, South won a succession of short corners but twice good strikes from Dave Monck were saved by the keeper. There were fifteen minutes left on the clock when the breakthrough finally came. Another push into the St Ives D saw Rob Barton pick up the ball, manoeuvre to create space and then jab the ball beyond the keeper.
On top and scenting a win, South refused to take their foot off the gas. A free hit was won just outside the St Ives D and the Monckosaurus stepped up to give the ball another taste of his particular hard-hitting punishment. Looking up, he spied the Cardinal lurking just outside the right post with Arsenal in front of him. Suddenly, Mark made a darting run, drawing his marker from in front of Kev just as the Monckosaurus unleashed the power, leaving the South captain to angle his stick and deflect the wide-bound ball past the stranded keeper.
Ten minutes to go and the 'big mo' was with South. With St Ives having no answer on the pitch, the game was thrown back into the mix by a second yellow card for South when Nick Bristowe, outstanding all game in the defensive midfield role, was judged to have verbally dissented an umpiring decision and received his marching orders.
St Ives seized their opportunity and, with bare minutes left on the clock, won a short corner. After a short pause while the umpire moved the goal posts another inch apart, the resulting shot was charged down and deflected off George Wych's stick high in the air towards goal. Standing on the line, Dave Monck instinctively raised his stick to protect those rough-hewn good looks and diverted the ball wide and over. The umpire however judged that the ball had been hit rather than blocked and signalled a penalty flick, which was despatched low to keeper Lino Di Lorenzo's right to level the scores.
On the overall balance of play, a draw was probably a reasonable result, but the late penalty flick was a bitter pill for South to swallow. Still undefeated in the league though, South came away proud of their performance and determined to make amends in their next game to get their promotion push back on course.
After the match, captain Kev Rowland said, ""We all felt somewhat disapointed in the draw after the team's gutsy and hard working performance on the day. We had nearly twenty minutes with only ten men on the field due to yellow cards, giving the opposition an advantage. Sometimes the odds are against you but I'm sure what happened on the pitch will only make the guys hungry for the win next weekand the return game.""","Men's 2nds v  : Awaiting Result","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

As ever, the talismanic captain stirred up passion, commitment and a hunger for the win, tempered only by the desire for quality passing, possession, movement and marking, our three most devastating weapons.
The Boston team assembled before us were mostly young and fleet of foot with two or three older and more experienced players. Unlike some other matches, South started brightly, posing most of the threats, and taking a deserved early lead through Mark Pears as he slipped the ball between the keeper and the post off a rebound.
Despite this bright start, both teams looked menacing on the break. South's defence snuffed out open play attacks effectively, though often lacking the coordinated discipline that have made South such a tough team to score against. South could have stretched their lead at several points, but Boston's keeper wasn't going to give away anything too easily. Despite the South pressure, Boston equalised with the only short corner of the half, a frustrating rebound that the defence failed to clear before one of their young whipper-snappers sneaked it into the corner.
1-1 at half time and South knew they were in a game and had to step up the tempo. More rousing words from the skipper and South set about the second half with purpose, quickly taking back the lead through Alex Pooles and another great shot, hit along the deck from the top right of the D with a slight right-to-left fade that brought it back just inside the near post, almost skimming the keeper's foot at it sneaked in.
Boston weren't quite done yet, and won the game's second short corner. Wych charged down the shot with his characteristic pace and tenacity, but deflected the shot up towards the goal, where another youthful scamp stuck out his stick (at something approaching shoulder height  though more like an adult's chest height) and steered the ball into the goal, to fierce protestations from Monck and Oren. South were in danger of losing another two points in a winnable game.
But this week was not the week before. South's defence reorganised themselves, taking pressure off the midfield and giving them more space. Shortly after, Tomita played what can only be described as the pass of the season. From close to our twenty-five yard right hand touchline he picked out Aston, flying into the opposite corner of the pitch. Three passes later and South were again back in front through a Tim Clapp finish, but this time determined to remain there.
With the South defence holding strong, Boston were struggling for attacking options. Price, in goal, in fact barely touched the ball in open play and it wasnt long before South surged forwards once again to make sure the game was theirs. South's fourth goal of the second half, a second for Tim, reflected the margin between the teams as the match drew to a close and this was capped minutes from the end with a fifth, courtesy of Arsenal. While Boston were in with a shout at half time, persistence and stamina saw South through to a convincing victory. Clapp's brace and his bump on the nose meant he richly deserved both MoM and Lemon awards.
South 2nds promotion hunt continues, but a whole match of real quality will be required against tough opposition at Newmarket next week.

They were ably supported by Ian Glover pushing further up from the back. Up front Shyam, playing only his fifth game for the team, was beginning to show some neat touches.
For twenty minutes, South dominated and only occasionally had to defend. Ely then released their secret weapon by bringing on to the right wing a player who looked no more than ten years old (he was probably older than ten). At first everyone was slightly worried they may hurt him as he was so tiny, but it soon emerged that he was very skilful. This lead to Ely beginning to win a number of short corners and they managed to work the ""slip it to the guy on the left"" routine and the player managed to score high off the keeper's pads.
With their confidence high, Ely managed a second before half time. South were equal to Ely in terms of possession and had a number of chances, but finishing was not South's strength on the day. Between the two goals, Phil Le Gouais managed to save brilliantly off Ky Ho who was trying to clear a ball out of the defence but was facing the wrong way at the time.
In the second half, South continued to attack in a similar manner to the first, but it was the familiar story of possession but lacking the finish. Ely managed to break and their striker got a goal from an unexpected shot. It was a good team effort despite the loss.

Both teams started strongly but South had more of the pressure and were soon in front when Emma Clarke flicked home from a rebound.
Excellent saves from the Newmarket keeper then frustrated the South forwards but another rebound after twenty minutes, this time from Kate Nustedt's short corner strike, made it two for both South and Emma Clarke. However Newmarket did not give up and pulled one back just before half time with a deflected shot from a short corner.
The second half saw some excellent and at times desperate defending from both sides and the result was in doubt until five minutes from the end, when Kate Nustedt dummied the Newmarket keeper and scored with a powerful strike to make the final result 3-1.

South put the opposing defense under strong pressure from the start and were unlucky after ten minutes when a flick from Emma Clarke came back off the inside of the post and was adjudged not to have crossed the line. Continued pressure and good runs from the forwards were eventually rewarded with a goal after half an hour when the ball was driven down the right wing and Jenny Fleck scored from close range.
Occasional forays by Cambridge Ladies into the Cambridge South half were expertly dealt with by the defense who stopped all their attacks from open play. However, shortly before half time a well worked short corner put Cambridge Ladies back on equal terms again.
In the second half South had all the pressure with several good runs from the forwards, well supported by halves Charlotte Page, Rachel Rule and Liz Brimer. Cambridge Ladies seemed to be trying for the draw as they never looked likely to score themselves due to the strength of the South defence. However, ten minutes from time a short corner strike by Liz Brimer put South back into the lead and gave them the victory.
In general this was a much improved performance. South put their training to good use, with their field placement and passing skills especially showing the benefit. Unusually they were also able to make use of rolling substitutes, having three extra players, which certainly enabled the team to finish the match strongly.","Ladies' 1sts beat Cambridge Ladies 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

However, once again South did not begin well, with a few players appearing rusty having not played for a few weeks. Passes went regularly astray as the play ranged from end to end and several times Sawtry's attacks were only denied by some excellent saves from goalkeeper Cassie Ragnauth. Meanwhile, for South, Kate Nustedt up front was playing with her usual enthusiasm and skill and was unlucky not to score on more than one occasion. Shortly before half time the deadlock was finally broken with a breakaway goal from Sawtry which caught most of the South players unawares.
Both teams made a couple of changes at half time and while South came out with renewed determination, Sawtry seemed to have got the tactics wrong by reshuffling their defence. By this time South were playing much more accurately and centre half Holly Joyce put a great through ball into the D for Kate Nustedt to level the score. Shortly afterwards a break down the right by South was followed by a cross from Kate Nustedt again that beat the goalkeeper and found newcomer Sharon McKay following up to score her first goal for the club.
A well worked short corner saw Emma Clarke net from the rebound and with the score now at 3-1 it was all over. Sawtry had very few attacks in the second half, all expertly dealt with by the defence, with Sue Snape and Caroline Bucknall proving very strong at the back and woman of the match Cassie Ragnauth showing how much she is enjoying her new role as goalkeeper.","Ladies' 1sts beat Sawtry 1 : Awaiting Result","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

The match was played in pouring rain throughout but this did not detract from a good spectacle, although the crowd watching was understandably depleted. Cambridge had several attacks in the first half but were unable to convert any of them and were a goal down at half time thanks to a well struck shot following a break by Bourne.
At half time South were reduced to ten men and had not really reorganized themselves sufficiently in time to prevent a goal right at the start of the second half. A cross from the right was tapped home by Bourne and from then on they were always going to win as South found it hard to come back from two goals and a man down. However some strong defending ensured that the score remained at just two. Cassie Ragnauth in goal again produced some fine saves, including a tip over the bar worthy of a premiership goalie. Katie Thornburrow put in some excellent work at centre back and received a nasty bang on the knee from a short corner for her efforts.
All in all, it was disappointing to lose but the team was not too disheartened as they felt they had put in an improved performance from their draw at St Ives the week before.","Ladies' 1sts lose to Bourne 2 ","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Playing a Wisbech side with a strong forward line and some very promising young players, South found the going difficult in defense and could never quite get into a scoring position up front either.
Once again the weather was not helpful but South could not give this as an excuse for a first half display that saw them concede three goals. Unfortunately, Wisbech were just a bit too good and put together some fine passes for each of their goals. A few of the South players were playing out of position and captain Rachel Rule did some reorganizing after the first goal, moving Charlotte Page to centre half where she had a strong game.
In the second half South put up a much better performance, preventing any further goals and putting together some breaks of their own but could not manage to produce a goal for their efforts. Katie Thornburrow, sporting an impressive bruise on her knee after last week's match, did extremely well at left back with some crucial tackles and was South's woman of the match.
Strong early season results mean that South go into the winter break with a mid-division position in the league. They will be looking to maintain this position at the very least in the new year.

South were determined to put up a better performance than the 14-1 loss back in September, where a number of the regular players were unavailable.
The game started with Huntingdon in typically strong attacking form. The South defence held on well until a misunderstanding at the back allowed Huntingdon to score from a weak shot. Shortly afterwards however, South were level. Centre forward Kate Nustedt made a decisive break and a well-timed pass allowed Emma Clarke to beat the oncoming goalkeeper. Sustained Huntingdon pressure saw them regain the lead but once again South pulled the score back, this time from a short corner, put in at close range by Emma Clarke for her second.
With the scores level at half time, South came out for the second half with renewed determination and for the first ten minutes they were definitely the better side. Huntingdon began to make errors and South could have gone ahead a couple times but were unlucky with shots going just wide. Huntingdon regrouped and as South began to tire they finally managed to score from a cross. Two more Huntingdon goals followed from set pieces in the last five minutes to make the final score 5-2.
However, South felt that they had played well and despite the loss were pleased with the performance, which was vastly improved from the last match against this side. Having raised their game for this match, the aim will be to maintain the same level of play for the rest of the season against lesser opposition.

However, illness meant that they started with only ten players which did not help their cause early on. A big thank you goes to Katie Thornburrow who got out of her sick-bed to come and play. Before her arrival, Sawtry went one up very early on from an unstoppable short corner strike.
The half term break had left a few players slightly ring-rusty and as usual it took South quite a while to warm up and get their eye in. The team was disappointed to go two down shortly before half time due to a slight misunderstanding in defence and enterprising play from the Sawtry forwards.
A rousing team talk from captain Rachel Rule at half time seemed to do the trick however. Striker Kate Nustedt led by example and South gained several short corners early on in the second half. Eventually one of these was forced home by left wing Emma Clarke to give South hope of a comeback. Soon after they were level when Rachel Rule's cross into the D was met by Kate Nustedt who scored with a neat flick.
The last ten minutes of the game was end to end and the result could have gone either way. Cassie Ragnauth in goal, sporting her new bright yellow kit, made two excellent saves late on to deny Sawtry. Special mention must also go to Claire Roberts who had an excellent game at right back in a defence that was extremely strong in the second half. In the end a draw was probably a fair result for both sides in an entertaining game.

For once they started strongly, and were soon ahead thanks to a good finish from Kate Nustedt. However, a short corner for St Ives saw them draw level with a fine strike that deceived the South goalkeeper. Shortly before half time however, South were back in front from one of their own short corners, Kate Nustedt claiming her second of the match.
The second half was very one sided. St Ives made a few forays into the South half but their young forward line was unable to get through the South defence. Player of the match Kate Nustedt claimed two more goals, both very well taken with first time shots following crosses into the D. South could have had several more goals, with at least one being cleared off the line.
In general South were pleased with both the result and their standard of play, especially as captain Rachel Rule had to do a fair amount of shuffling with players and positions.

Matches between the two sides have always been hard fought, with Wisbech usually coming out on top, and it was about time for South to turn this recent run around.
South started this game brightly and soon had chances. Natacha Cox and Rosie Dias up front were combining very well, ably supported by Jenny Fleck in the unfamiliar role of Centre Half. Their efforts were soon rewarded when Rosie crossed into the D for Natacha to put South 1-0 up. Not long afterwards it was Rosie's turn to get onto the score sheet, this time Natacha was the provider and Rosie's shot easily beat the Wisbech keeper.
After this great start, South had several more good attacks but were unable to score another. Instead it was Wisbech who pulled one back just before half time.
The second half saw South defending well in order to keep their lead. Elena deAngelis, Ruth Jempson, Jodee Davis and Claire Roberts were all extremely solid at the back and only rarely did Wisbech look like scoring. One of these times was right at the end from a short corner and only an excellent save from volunteer keeper Caroline Bucknall kept South's lead. Up front South had a few chances to score but were unable to convert any of them. However the whole team was delighted to record their first league win, especially over a team that has proved difficult to beat in the past.","Ladies' 1sts beat Wisbech Town 2 ","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Still two players down with 10 of their extra 15 minutes used up, South were forced to start with only ten players for the first couple of minutes.
Not surprisingly, South were a little bit disorganized and were unlucky that Sawtry started fiercely and went 2-0 up very quickly. The first goal came from a short corner and the second from some good attacking play.
After this initial shock, South regrouped and put some good play together for the rest of the first half. Centre forward Kate Nustedt was unlucky not to score with a great shot just before half time.
The second half also started well for South and only several excellent saves from the Sawtry keeper kept the South forwards at bay. Then a break away by Sawtry saw South concede a penalty flick in order to prevent a goal. Keeper Cassie Ragnauth made an excellent save to keep the score at 2-0.
Unfortunately, that was the end of the good news for South. As they began to tire, Sawtry scored two more breakaway goals to make the final result 4-0. All in all this was an unlucky match. The result did not reflect the periods of play when South put some good moves together and they will certainly be looking to exact revenge in the return match next year.","Ladies' 1sts lose to Sawtry 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

After a fast start, with both sides having chances, South went one up after ten minutes. The play came down the right from half Charlotte Page and all three forwards were involved in the D before the ball came loose for left wing Emma Clarke to score from close range.
March kept up their attacks and scored a lucky goal soon afterwards. The ball was crossed into the circle from a long corner and, with the South defence believing it had gone off the back, it somehow squeezed past goalkeeper Cassie Ragnauth for a March forward to pop it home.
However, it was not long before South were back in front. Centre forward Tash Cox picked up a ball from Gemma Thomas and ran through to score a fantastic solo goal. In fact, South could have gone in to the break 3-1 up, a cracking shot from a short corner by Gemma going just inches wide. Other action in the first half included a fantastic save by Cassie from a short corner and some very good defending by backs Claire Roberts, Sue Snape and Caroline Bucknall, with sweeper Ruth Jempson proving extremely solid and her trademark reverse stick clearance working to good effect.
After the break, both teams were pressing hard, South looking for a two goal cushion and March trying to find the equalizer. It was the latter who scored after fifteen minutes when a lifted shot, indirectly from a short corner, managed to beat all the South defence.
South kept going and several times were unlucky not to score. Finally, it was excellent pressure in the D from Tash and Rosie Dias, who were put through after a run from centre back Sue, that again forced the goalkeeper to commit and allowed Emma Clarke to score a carbon copy of her first goal. This goal came with just a minute to go and South easily held on for a well deserved victory.
All in all this was an excellent match, with both sides playing extremely well. There was very good linking from all areas of the pitch, with halves Gemma, Charlotte and Liz Brimer providing great support to the forwards. Tash Cox deservedly won player of the match for her brilliant goal and various other heroics.","Ladies' 1sts beat March Town 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

However, as it turned out, this was actually a comfortable win. South started well and were always on top. They went one up after five minutes when centre half Gemma Thomas passed to right wing Jo Read and her shot from the edge of the D was turned in by striker Tash Cox. Shortly afterwards, South were two ahead, a short corner struck accurately and fast by Gemma giving no chance at all to the City keeper.
City immediately made four substitutions but the new players were still unable to find a way through the strong South defence. In one of their few attacking plays, sweeper Ruth Jempson for South was unlucky to suffer a nasty cut to her chin following a swipe from an over-enthusiastic City forward and had to go off for treatment, ably assisted by Cassie Ragnauth's parents. After some swift rearrangement, South regrouped and held out well until half time.
The second half went in a similar vein to the first. South scored their third goal not long after the break, with Tash Cox persevering against some desperate City defending to force the ball home. From then on South were always coasting to victory and although City had quite a bit of play in the last quarter, they rarely managed to trouble the South keeper.
After another promising win, South will be looking to continue this good form in their last two league matches before Christmas.
Player of the match was Gemma Thomas, who controlled the midfield and added a goal for good measure.","Ladies' 1sts beat Cambridge City 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

After the usual false starts in trying to find the ground, South managed to start with nearly eleven on the pitch and were soon up to their full complement. This was always going to be a tough match and South had several members playing out of their usual position, all of whom did extremely well. Peterborough pressed hard from the start and it was a few minutes before South managed to make any meaningful forward breaks. However, they kept going and the defence always seemed to be in control, despite absorbing a lot of pressure.
South gradually worked their way into the game and had a couple of good chances, before going one up after about twenty minutes. A good ball out of defence by left back Caroline Bucknall was picked up by the forwards and after Peterborough cleared from the D once, right wing Rosie Dias put the ball back in and it was collected by centre forward Tash Cox who scored with a neat shot. South then kept things tight at the back and were happy to go into the break ahead.
In the second half, Peterborough piled on the pressure and all those in defence were kept extremely busy. Keeper Cassie Ragnauth made save after save and everyone at the back worked extremely hard to keep clearing the ball. South had to defend a number of short corners, once of which included a lifted shot that was turned away expertly by Caroline Bucknall. South had a few of their own chances as well and could have scored again but bad luck and a couple of Peterborough feet kept them out.
Five minutes before the end, Peterborough finally forced the ball home to draw level. They kept pressing for the winner but good defending by South kept them out and the final score was probably the right result, although South were a bit disappointed not to have held out for the win.
Special mentions must go to sweeper Sue Snape who kept playing through a back injury and Jo Read who played left half for the first time and had an excellent match. The player of the match was Cassie for her superb performance in goal, watched by husband Chris who had picked a good match to come along to.","Ladies' 1sts draw with Peterborough Town 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Deeping are a new side who are hoping to join the league next season and in the meantime are playing as many friendlies as possible.
The match was played on the brand new Perse Girls school pitch, which was appreciated by everyone. South had plenty of players available which meant that there were a number of rolling subs throughout the match and allowed everyone to get some pitch time while also playing themselves back into form after nearly a six week break.
From the start it was clear that South were the better side, although Market Deeping were enthusiastic and determined and made a number of good breaks. South went one up after ten minutes from a short corner which was well struck by centre half Gemma Thomas and then made it 2-0 before the break when after a scramble in the goalmouth the ball was pushed home by right wing Rosie Dias.
After half time and a number of changes on the South side, it was Deeping's turn to get on the score sheet, also from a short corner. Their fight back was short lived however as South centre forward Tash Cox added two more goals, including an excellent first time touch in from a cross by right half Liz Tattersall.
This was a good work out for South and was appreciated by Market Deeping, who should do very well in the 2nd Division of the Cambridgeshire league next season.","Ladies' 1sts beat Market Deeping 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Their previous meeting had resulted in a 1-0 win for Ladies and South were looking for revenge as they felt that this had been an unlucky loss.
South took the first push back and after centre half Gemma Thomas had surprised captain Rachel Moyes with a square pass, South got themselves together and began to play some good hockey. They had several chances early on and only excellent saves by the Ladies goalkeeper prevented centre forward Tash Cox and right wing Rosie Dias from scoring. Ladies were solid in defence and kept on frustrating the South forwards. They made several breaks themselves which were dealt with expertly by the South defence and meant that goalkeeper Cassie Woodfin was rarely troubled.
After half time, South were looking to get the win and began to put some good passing movements together. However, time and again the ranks of Ladies defenders managed to keep South at bay, with their tactic of stacking several defenders one behind the other proving quite effective. South also had a number of short corners, including one great strike from Gemma Thomas that was turned away on the line by the Ladies' central defender.
Finally, five minutes before the end, the deadlock was broken. Gemma Thomas took a free hit from outside the D and drove a hard shot straight at goal which was turned in first time by left wing Emma Clarke. South then comfortably held out for the remaining time and were thrilled to gain a well deserved win.
This was a good start to the second half of the season and South will be looking to maintain this level of form for their remaining matches.","Ladies' 1sts beat Cambridge Ladies 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

After a delayed start, the first goal of the day (and there were, once again, quite a few) came early from Cambridge South's centre half, Gemma Thomas. A great solo effort, Gemma managed to chip the goalkeeper at a tight angle. For the next ten minutes Cambridge South dominated, with several good chances on goal, but couldn't add to the score line.
Gradually Sawtry's strong passing game emerged, stretching the Cambridge defence and eventually forcing the equalizer. Cambridge, undeterred, battled on, with several good passes leading to goal-scoring opportunities for forward Tash Cox.
Unfortunately, with just minutes to half time, Sawtry squeezed another goal.
Cambridge came out strongly from half time and for the first few minutes again dominated the early play. But Sawtry settled and, after some excellent skill, managed another two, very good goals.
Despite the three goal deficit, Cambridge carried on. Throughout the game the Cambridge South goalkeeper, Cassie Woodfin made some great saves, the best deep in the second half when she dived to the bottom left corner.
Cambridge South's spirit never faltered and after a lot of hard work from all the team, Gemma Thomas again managed another terrific goal - a shot straight into the bottom left corner.
It was the last goal of the game and the strong Sawtry team were deserved 4-2 winners. But Cambridge South demonstrated some excellent individual performances, a sustained battling team spirit and can take some pride in the much-improved scoreline.","Ladies' 1sts lose to Sawtry 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Their win over March before Christmas was the only points that the league leaders had dropped all season and they had beaten everyone else with depressing ease.
However, South were not overawed and knew that they had a strong team, despite the absence of captain Rachel Moyes and also stalwarts Caroline Bucknall and Tash Cox, who were both recovering from flu.
The match started well with both sides trading attacks. Gemma Thomas made some fine attacking runs and put in several good crosses that the South forwards were just unable to get their sticks on. Meanwhile, the defence was also strong, with sweeper Ruth Jempson and goalie Cassie Woodfin doing plenty of shouting and making some good saves and tackles when called upon.
Twenty minutes in, and slightly against the run of play, South managed to break the deadlock. Right half Liz Tattersall, who had an excellent game, put in a great through pass to free left wing Emma Clarke, who ran on to it and beat the goalkeeper, much to Emma's surprise. March immediately came back strongly but South comfortably held out to half time.
The second half looked like being hard work for South, with March determined to score and making repeated attacks. Some good tackles and strong defence of numerous short corners kept the score at 1-0 until fifteen minutes from the end. A March forward struck a solid shot into the D which smacked straight onto the end of Ruth Jempson's hand. As she yelled and dropped her stick, with a lot of blood immediately evident, all the players of both sides naturally stopped also. Unfortunately the March umpire had other ideas and as he shouted 'play on', a March forward reacted first and pushed the ball into the goal. South were naturally upset, feeling that this was unsportsmanlike play at the very least, even while agreeing that it was not perhaps against the letter of the law.
However, there was a match to finish and after Ruth's wounds were tended to, with no sub available there was a certain amount of reorganization to do. Gemma dropped back to sweeper, with Emma moving to centre half, leaving the mother and daughter combination of Anne Swinney and Rosie Dias up front. In this formation, South managed to hold out until the end of the match, despite March desperately pushing for a winner and another injury scare to left back Sue Snape.
All in all, South had to be pleased with this result, although less happy that several of their players came away with injuries. Everyone in the team worked extremely hard and put together some quality passing moves, coupled with first-rate defending. Special mention must go to Jodee Davis who had an excellent game at centre back, sticking to the March centre forward like glue, and Claire Roberts at right back who made some vital tackles, especially in the last ten minutes when South were down to ten. Jo Read also worked tirelessly at left half and managed to support most of the attacks as well as defending with determination.","Ladies' 1sts draw with March Town 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

In the first half both teams seemed equally matched. Cassie Woodfin, the South goalkeeper, produced an excellent save off the line to prevent Ladies from scoring. South started with plenty of energy and fight for the game and managed some great long range passing skills. Unfortunately, Cambridge Ladies got the first goal of the half, but undeterred South continued to battle.
Rebecca Lumb produced some fine tackles in defence throughout the game and on one occasion passed the ball to Tash Cox, who slipped the ball through to Emma Clarke, who managed to thread an excellent weighted pass through to Gemma Thomas, who had beaten all defenders and sent the ball flying into the goal. Cambridge South were back level.
After half time. Cambridge South came out strong and feeling confident they could win this game. Both teams had many penalty corners in the second half, and many close chances on goal. In one particular corner, Emma hit the ball out to Gemma waiting at the top of the D, who drilled the ball back into the crowded goal where Emma Clarke again found it and managed to hook it back and chip it into the goal. South were now in the lead.
As the game went on, Ladies battled on, trying for their equalizer, but to no avail for South's defenders Ruth and Rachel (captain) were on form and made any necessary challenges clearing South's area. Rosie Dias made some excellent runs up the right connecting well with centre forward Tash Cox.

Wisbech started strongly, a good attacking force prompting South's goalkeeper, Cassie Woodfin, to make some fine saves. But it didn't take long for South to get into their stride, with fast attacks on both wings. Tash Cox also ran well as centre forward and, like Emma Clarke, was unlucky not to score.
Cambridge South did find the back of the net first but the effort was disallowed, a Wisbech stick adjudged to have tapped in. Both sides redoubled their efforts after this drama and the half ended with plenty of end-to-end chances, but the score still 0-0.
The second half started in much the same vein. South had many chances but just couldn't find the goal. Then, midway in the half and somewhat against the run of play, Wisbech scrambled a controversial goal that seemed similar to South's previously disallowed effort.
South battled on, with Becca Lumb in midfield working hard alongside Liz B, who made some excellent tackles to bring an attack. With only minutes to go, Wisbech squeezed another goal, the last of the game. But right to the final whistle battling Cambridge South displayed real commitment and never stopped pushing for a goal.
After the game, courtesy of Liz T and Becca, both teams enjoyed tea and delicious sandwiches (in the foyer!) and, despite the defeat, South can be pleased at the performance shown.

With this much deserved great start, Cambridge South continued to work their magic with Tash, Emma and Gemma having many chances at goal. Sawtry didnt seem to react to going 0-1 down and Cambridge kept possession for most of the rest of the half.
After half time Sawtry started in better form and through some good long range passing they managed a goal from a much-disputed penalty corner. This didn't deter South and, once again, after plenty of great passes through midfield an attempt shot at goal was deflected to Tash, who finished the job to give South back the lead they thoroughly deserved.
The third and final goal came minutes later with great build up work once again, which found Jo R at the baseline where she pulled the ball back to Liles running in, who produced a spectacular finish to top off South's performance.

Liles broke free on the right several times in the half and every time the ball wasn't far from the back of the goal.

Bourne never seemed to get out of their half and after absorbing a lot of pressure a neat ball from South's midfield was threaded through to Tash Cox who took the ball round the keeper to give South a 3-0 lead.
Bourne went on to make two substitutions, later proved to be illegal to the Cambridgeshire League Rules, and did put some pressure on South's defence, leading to a goal near to full time.

With Gemma Thomas bringing the ball from midfield into the shooting area, she hammered the ball to the far post where Jo Read was waiting to tuck it in the goal. South's lead didnt last long however. Towards the end of the first half Newmarket broke down the right side and managed to score minutes before half time.

After a minimalist team talk from Emily/Harry, Cambridge South were straight away on the ascendancy with a great run from Parker (Gemma) to the back line, who pulled it back to be only narrowly missed by Caroline.
I cannot remember exactly what happened but there was some great passing, moving and support. Eventually a run into the D by Virgil resulted in a close range conversion to give the birthday girl her first (of many Im sure) of the season. After some more great (everything was great) play, including some excellent battling by Cat in the midfield, sterling defence by Louisa, Ellie, Becca and Jodee, and narrow misses, Claire finished off a move that began in the midfield to give us a 2-0 lead for half time.
In the second half Saffron Walden came out attacking, with what we think were 5 forwards. One move did almost come to something but was thwarted by an incredible reaction save from Cassie, ensuring Cambridge South would keep a clean sheet. Despite tired legs South battled on and always looked favourites to win 50:50 balls. There were many great moves with Claire, Caroline and Gemma linking up fantastically. Further goals by Claire and Gemma gave South a comfortable 4-0 win.
Despite having never played together, South worked really hard for each other, communicated and supported well. All in all things look promising for the coming season. There was not a vote for Lady of the match, however Cassie was later proposed (because she made the whole sideline whoop!) and the decision seconded by the vice captain. Jolly good show.

Septembers day saw the South Ladies first team taking on co-promotees Newmarket in a league cup game. The legendary Cassie was not present as she was on babysitting duty but I said Id mention her so I am back to the game. With only 9 players 5 minutes before push back, Souths prematch preparations were limited, but after surviving horrendous traffic and not turning back Tash and Liles turned up in the nick of time, running on to the pitch as the whistle went.
It was incredibly hard work in that hot sun and Newmarket were playing an unusual formation that, along with switching forwards, left our midfield overloaded (and tired out). South were afforded the occasional break, but the forwards and midfield struggled to get past Newmarkets high defence. Unfortunately for South, Newmarket battled through our defence and went 1-0 up.
South continued fighting; Liles began a breaking run down the right side of the pitch, which sadly ended in a clash and the ball being lifted into her nose. This was the day that I realised I am not that good with gushing blood. Newmarket were quick to act with compresses being offered left, right and centre. Tash borrowed Emmas towel in the absence of Souths full first aid kit! Liles was brought off the pitch and had to be taken to Addenbrookes to glue her nose back on, escorted by Tash. This left rookie captains Gem-ley to make some important decisions. Given the weather, it seemed cruel to make the team carry on 2 girlies down, but when asked the South ladies were as up for it as ever (well until half time at least!). So we ignored Newmarkets offer of players and battled on, in honour of Liles.
After a rejig of positions which saw forwards Emma and Caroline back in defence, we soon found ourselves 2-0 down (ahem). However! This was against the run of play as South came out all guns blazing making the most of the extra space. Bex was our lone striker and her running gave Newmarket a lot to think about. Our new defence broke down everything thrown at them, whilst Newmarket left themselves open at the back. This allowed Emma to get the ball upfield to Bex who held the ball up brilliantly, and on this occasion won a free hit at the top of the D. Quick thinking Ciara Knightley Metcalfe took a quick free hit with a deft pass into the path of Hayley who dived (perhaps excessively, who is to say?) to touch the ball underneath an outrushing goalkeeper. The ball trickled over the line and South were right back in it. Another chance came from left back Emma, pushing up and crossing superbly only to be narrowly missed by Bex. Half time and South were on a high.
The second half saw some solid defending keeping Newmarket penalty corners at bay, and some lovely link up play between Knightley and Gemma. South worked the space well and broke down every single Newmarket attack fantastically. The last quarter saw a tired but relentless South battle on with Gemma hitting magnificently out of defence for Bex to go and cause trouble. Caroline, Louisa, Jo, and Emma tackled and channelled like I have never seen before. At the other end, Hayley and Knightley squandered two great opportunities, and South were unable to convert 4 penalty corners.
Despite losing we came off the pitch happy as a bunch of Larries with a true team performance and the promise that with a full team we can do very well this season. No match teas for us this week as the seconds needed our sweaty shirts, and umpires, so again no MOM vote cast. After Gem-ley-based discussions Emma Clarke was awarded MOM for sterling work in all aspects, with key tackles in defence and superb balls to aid the attack.
Great effort Emma, glad to see you back!

Hard work saw us gather a team together, with skipper Vickys efforts aided by some sterling recruitment from Perse teacher Cat, bringing some of her pupils along with her, who all went on to put in impressive performances.
We won the toss and picked to push back. Saffron chose the ends and as it worked out we were shooting into the sun for the first half. Ellie took the push back and the game started. Saffron pushed hard into our half and we struggled to defend the attack. The first ten minutes were very hard due to the fact that we had never played together as a team. We didnt talk to each other or support and not knowing each other compounded that fact. After the initial attack from Saffron, 3 players switched positions Lou went to RB, Vicky to CB and Phillippa to CM. That change made a big difference to the team as we pushed forward harder and kept them at bay in their own half.
We took the lead towards the end of the half, when Helen intercepted an Saffron 16-yard-hit, showed a nice trick to beat the first tackler and reach the circle, from where a good clean early hit found the far corner. This goal gave a positive vibe to the half-time teamtalk, with Vicky asking for more calling, movement off the ball and encouraging her team to look for the short pass rather than the big hit, especially from defensive 16s. Cassie from her role as keeper asked the team to make more use of width, as most attacks were going down the throat of Saffrons strong central defence. The final point from Cathy & Jo was that we were playing too nice, with Jo summing it up with a neat aphorism, We need to be first in the queue, so go and fight for the ball.
The second half started with Saffron having the push back and they started to attack, but with our new found confidence and also playing with the sun on our backs, we pushed forward into their half. Helen doubled the lead when she drove down the right channel, and crossed the ball onto a defenders foot, from where it looped really high in the air. Everyone stopped, except Umpire Emma who correctly waited to see if the ball would land anywhere advantageous before blowing for the penalty corner, which it most emphatically did, coming down with snow on it into the Saffron goal.
Goals came thick and fast as Cat slotted a third, rapping home a loose ball in the circle, followed by a very sneaky shot from Emily that bounced off the post and went in, a very popular goal with her teammates. Finally Ellie scored with a clean hit from the edge of the circle, which was a real boost for her as she had worked so hard throughout the game.
For the last ten minutes again we had to battle to keep our clean sheet, but with Cassie holding fast despite all the short corners being conceded we won the game 5 goals to nil.","Ladies' 2nds beat Saffron Walden 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

South were taking on a Peterborough 3rds side that they had beaten in a friendly at the end of last season, so hopes were high of a good start to the new campaign. This was further boosted when it was pointed out that Peterborough had only brought 10 players, but given the sterling performance that South put up with 9 players against Newmarket last week, they were taking nothing for granted.

Well, what can I say, theres not enough room to describe all the goals in detail and to be honest, there were so many that afterwards no-one could really remember what order they were scored in. CF Tash Cox definitely got the first after only 10 minutes, picking up a rebound and putting the ball neatly past the keeper. RW Claire Wylie got into a great position in the D for the second, her shout was heard by CH Gemma Thomas who found her with an inch perfect pass that Claire smacked past the on-rushing goalie.

From then on the goals went in regularly. South were 5-0 up at half time, thanks to further goals from LW Emma Clarke, LH Ciara Metcalfe and Claire again.

Meanwhile the rest of the team were doing great work passing the ball around and feeding it through for the many attacks. Unfortunately on-pitch captain Hayley, who had been causing Peterborough plenty of problems in midfield, received a nasty knock to her hand and had to go off. However, South barely broke stride with Liles Dee, sporting two healing black eyes from last weeks match, slotting neatly into the RH position. Hayley contented herself with shouting from the sideline and it was remarked afterwards that she could be heard from all corners of the pitch, which meant that no-one dared to try and take it easy, even when we approached double figures.

After half time it was more of the same. The first attack brought a short corner, courtesy of Claire kindly stopping a ball that came out of defence at shoulder height, with luckily not too much damage done. For once the South corner routine worked perfectly and Gemmas shot hit the backboard for goal number 6.

Other goals of note included Ciaras full stretch sweep shot and a great pick up by Julie Sadler at the far post after the ball had ping-ponged between most of the forwards who all managed not to score. In the end the tally was 3 for Ciara and Claire (although Claire did admit to poaching one that was already going in), 2 for Emma and Gemma and 1 each for Tash and Julie.

To their credit, Peterborough never gave up and battled hard all the way through, but the slick passing and one-touch hockey of the whole South team meant that Peterborough could never keep the ball for any sustained length of time. Cassie in goal had only 3 saves to make which she did with great confidence to keep another clean sheet while Louisa, Becca, Jodee and Ellie combined brilliantly in defence and even got the switching round the back working which shows how much confidence the team were playing with!

Special mention must go to man of the match Ciara, who had a storming game in midfield including her hat trick, and dufus of the day, umpire Rob Garrett for locking his keys in the boot of his car. Nice one Rob  thanks for umpiring though  much appreciated!

So a 12-0 win to kick off the league campaign  what a fantastic start to the season - our goal difference is through the roof and we are top of the table until next Saturday at least!","Ladies' 1sts thrash Peterborough Town 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

However, we soon found our stride and started to work well together as a team. This included Sarah A, who despite having never played in goal volunteered herself for this position (much to everyone else's relief).

Our first goal came from some hard battling by the midfield and forwards and was eventually slotted away by Bex. There was some excellent work from Ellie who drove the ball forward and set up a lot of our attacking phases. Ellie, who is a pupil at the Perse School, was unanimously voted as outstanding player of the match for her excellent input. It was Ellie who hit an excellent ball into the D for her school team mate Cathy to put into the back of the goal to double South's lead.

The match saw a lot of effort from the team as a whole and this was evident in the voting for the player who had input the most effort as this was a tie between Cat E and Sarah C. Suzanne unfortunately sustained a muscle injury close to the end of the first half but luckily Pip was on hand to take over at left back.

Cambridge South dominated much of the second half with St Neots struggling to clear the ball off the 16. There were times when we were put under pressure and the defenders dealt with this well including Kat and Vicki (captain) who proved very reliable, and Sarah who made an excellent save to protect her clean sheet.","Ladies' 2nds beat St Neots 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Unfortunately, it was back down to earth with a bit of a bump.
Right from the start, in what was a bad-tempered and frustrating match, Newmarket were always stronger, and their first goal came inside 10 minutes, when a neat move saw one of their players unmarked in the D. Newmarket scored twice more before half time, once from a short corner that was forced home from close range, and then from another breakaway.
Some reorganization at half time saw South go back to a sweeper system from the 3-4-3 they had started with. This more defensive attitude paid off for most of the half, with MOM Louisa Richmond-Coggan making some great tackles at the back and GK Sarah Massen putting together a series of skilful saves. However, South did let slip another goal, again from a short corner that was deflected home.
On the attacking front, there was some good work, with the midfield working tirelessly to get the ball up to the forwards. However, South were too often caught in possession and Newmarket won many more of the 50-50 balls than South did. It must be said that they wanted it more than we did on this occasion. South will need to regroup and rethink their strategy before next week.","Ladies' 1sts lose to Newmarket 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

The early push-back of Saturday's derby match between Cambridge South 1sts, sponsored by PwC, and Cambridge City 3rds perhaps explained a slightly slow start from both teams. After a few minutes, the nominal visitors looked impressive in one of their first short corners, neatly crossing the D a few times and eventually taking a goal off the rebound. It was not long before South replied with a goal of their own after Gemma picked up a rebound and lifted it over the goalies foot. South now in their game were moving the ball around well. The next goal arrived before half time, with a number of South's forwards steering the ball towards goal and Liles having the final touch. Persistence in the goal area proved essential to get past City's experienced goalkeeper. Sometime during the first half of the game, South gained the benefit of booming encouragement from the sideline, noticeably Becca.
Half time, South were 2-1 up. South had played well in the first half and continued to improve throughout, but everyone agreed at half time that we could be more alert and improve accuracy and speed of passes. The third goal came when South's forwards were backed up by Ciara who took the ball back in to the D, swiped the ball towards goal on her reverse stick to be tapped in by Clare. Going for the fourth goal, Hayley made a dramatic dive towards goal, unfortunately failing to get the ball in the back of the net. A short corner provided another opportunity for goal, where the ball was injected to Tash, who smacked it sweetly only to be deflected off the oppositions stick. The ball flew over the back net, nearly in to the car park by a police van.
South's backs kept a robust line of defence enabling the team to focus on linking the play and moving the ball up forward. City continued to make their attacks on South. When they did break through our defence, Cassie was there, making some impressive diving saves to keep South's lead.
After Hayley's dives, and other attacking play, it seemed ironic that a push from a short-corner was the shot to evade City's defence. Clare's shot drifted gently through all the defence and past the goalie to make it 4-1.
It was a good result for South, especially since City played well and never gave up. South were more persistent on goal. As ever South's commitment to 'the beautiful game' (ahem) was marked by bloody socks as a result of minor injuries this week to Hayley and Ciara. Well done all.","Ladies' 1sts beat local rivals Cambridge City 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Saturday saw a frustrating 2-1 loss for Cambridge South 2nds against Cambridge Ladies 2nds. South got off to a slow start with an early goal from Ladies...maybe as a result of a not very thorough warm up! New additions to the 2nds meant we had little practice of playing together. The new Dutch girls  Anne and Maud, were dominant throughout with strong hits and relentless support...as well as causing the odd injury to the opposition! Along with Ellie and Cat there were numerous solid passes into the D but frustratingly finishing proved difficult, with some unlucky misses from Bex and Mel up front. Katie, Leila and Anne-Isabelle worked well in defence managing to stop some great attacks from Ladies. Lou needed to make some good saves to keep the final score as 2-1.
The score was 1-0 at half time and following a motivating pep talk from Captain Vicky South came back stronger in the 2nd half making much better use of the width of the pitch. However, more practice is still needed to play the ball out wide. There were some frustrating short corners with goals being narrowly missed but South did finally score in the 2nd half when Cat finished off a goal. The beginning of the 2nd half also saw a painful injury for Suzanne  breaking her thumb when defending a short corner...we hope youre ok! A few interesting decisions were noted by the Umpire...one of which then put Ladies in the lead 2-1.
There is definite potential for us to perform well as a team once we have more practice playing together  we just need to sharpen up on our communication, use of the pitch and more importantly score more goals!!!

It was unusual because we had Gemma, Jodee, Julie and Claire who usually play for the 1st team. A shortage in numbers and the desire to play the friendly was enough reason to draft in some extra players. It was agreed that the 2nd team ladies should play in their normal positions and the 1st ladies would drift in around. Unfortunately we still had a shortage of 2 players so we borrowed Saffron Waldens subs. The line up was Lou (GK), Sarah A.(sweeper), Jodee (LB), Julie (RB), Vicky (CB), Cat (CM), Gemma (CM), Hannah (Saffron Walden LM), Sarah C. (RM), Claire (RF) and Imogen (LF).
In the first few minutes a short corner was awarded to Saffron Walden  no score thanks to the fantastic jumping save made by Lou. The ball was struck and deflected off Vickys stick up into the air and Lou comfortably pushed it over the goal.
We pushed forward hard with Gemma playing solidly through the middle pushing out to the forwards on the left and right. Julie fought hard against their strongest player with Saffron playing firmly down the left wing. We scored 3 goals in the first half with Cat and Claire scoring one a piece and Gemma worked hard for the 3rd goal but passed the ball to Hannah to score.
After the 3rd goal Gemma was removed from her position by Emma (umpiring) and so Gemma became sweeper and Sarah Aves moved into the CM position. At the same time Jodee moved to LM to allow Imogen to play as a defender (which was a good move as she was more comfortable there).
At half time a few changes were made Sarah C moved to RF, Claire dropped back to RM but Hannah was struggling to keep possession of the ball. After Gemma pointed out we didnt really use the right we tried to improve and push the ball to both sides of the pitch. Julie still battled against her left wing but tried to intercept the ball before it arrived rather than tackling after she had possession. Her logic seemed to be prevention rather than the cure and it worked.
With Gemma covering behind the defence the attackers struggled to push through and achieve a comfortable strike at goal so Lou called for defenders to mark up and then Gemma arrived to save the day. We eventually scored again with Sarah C taking the score line up to 4-0 with a cross from Claire into the D. Jodee coped well up the left side with little support but luckily with Imogen backing her up.
The Man of the Match is: Julie for battling hard throughout the game to keep their left wing at bay. With a big thank you for all the 1st team ladies who played and Emma for umpiring.

Having won this fixture 2 weeks ago South were aware that City would come out hard to get revenge, and indeed this was the case. South were punished if they hung onto the ball too long and needed to raise their game. Worryingly after only 5 minutes Emma was involved in clash that aggravated her pre-existing shoulder injury, luckily Claire was waiting in the wings to take her place.
After absorbing pressure and neutralising a couple of City penalty corners South threatened on the break, with quick thinking from the backs on free hits. Hayley weaved past 3 city players to set Claire off on run into the D, this time to no avail. The City keeper was quick off the mark. The next run went all the way to the last defender, where Hayley slipped a ball past for Caroline to sprint onto and slot the ball past the out rushing keeper. South were 1-0 up and rampant.
More pressure came as Liles and Caroline attacked well down the right wing, always looking to cross for the encroaching forwards. Claire scored the second with some great individual skill. Cambridge City never gave up and battled on winning more PCs. Having dealt with one penalty corner Ciara brought the ball out of defence and spotted the run of Liles, playing a great long ball up the pitch. Liles picked up the ball on the top of the D, used her strength and skill to beat a defender and was then one on one with the keeper, no messin' South were 3-0 up on the stroke of half time.
In the second half City again came out strong, Bek and Ciara worked well in the middle to break down any central offence, whilst Julie and Ellie ran their socks off up and down with their wingers. Cassie was left with little to do. Eventually the South midfield took control once more and threaded passes through for all the forwards to have attempts on goal. Gemma's runs from the midfield left city players wondering what just flew past them, but even with her new super stick, a goal did not come.
Unfortunately for South the City keeper was on form and South were unable to convert any out of a string of penalty corners. In the end South had the majority of the chances and were deserved victors. After the game Hayley, the on-pitch captain, praised her team for a solid performance and great effort in all quarters.

This week we worked much more effectively together as a team using the techniques suggested by the captain and our more experienced players.

Our strong defence, of Jodee, Becca, and Vicky werent tested too much during the match, and efficiently cleared the ball when they had to, back to the mid-field. Nearly everyone got on the score-sheet (Except Lou who had a fairly quiet match really), thanks to the strength of passing from our midfield players, all of whom scored, as well as supplying the forwards with a constant supply of shots on goal.
At half time the score was 7-0 and the second half saw more of the same with another six goals. It has to be said that Rutlands goalkeeper had no kit so for most of the match she played as a sort-of second sweeper but the win cannot be taken away from us as we (mostly) played carefully around the goal to prevent any injury!
Overall the match importantly boosted team morale and has really helped us gel as a team. Hopefully this has given us confidence for the rest of the season and we can carry on the good work!

The game began slowly with South not having to play their usual game to create a plethora of chances. A break from midfield saw a lay off to Liles, and a finish by Caroline to give South the lead. Caroline was there again to put us 2-0 in front.
By now it was starting to click for Cambridge, who were enjoying the majority of possession. The March goalkeeper and committed sweeper ensured that it was not a whitewash, but finally Gemma used some fancy stick work to bewilder the defence and slot in a third before half time.
The feeling at half time was that we needed to raise our game and really take control. We also welcomed onto the pitch 1st team debutant Ellie Herbert who provided speed and intelligent passing. Some slick play down the right hand side resulted in a cross met by Emma at the near post who deftly touch ed the ball past the keeper. A really well worked goal.
South were now in control playing some great hockey and creating dozens of chances. Gemma grabbed the final goal of the game, giving South a convincing scoreline. I must give credit to the March goalkeeper and sweeper who kept the score down, and indeed credit to our front line who created so many opportunities.

In contrast to the previous week, the defence were really put to the test in this hard fought battle. Huntingdon played with very high forwards constantly switching. They played route one hockey which was effective in the beginning, as a stretched South defence conceded a penalty corner, from which Huntingdon scored the opening goal.
After this South were determined to fight back, Huntingdon defended deep with most of their players behind the ball. South won penalty corners, but again were unable to convert, with Gemma coming very close. After great pressure on the Huntingdon defence the ball was passed out wide to Emma on the left wing who dribbled to the by line (just like Sean told us to!) and pulled it back for Liles to tap in past the keeper. 1-1 at half time and South were determined to pull this back. The defence was more settled and the midfield could beat their opposite numbers.
It was much the same in the second half, South dominating the possession and coming close to scoring on a number of occasions. The last five minutes saw a surge of pressure with shots flying at the Huntingdon 'keeper. It seemed as though it wasn't to be our day, when all of a sudden Emma came out of the midfield once more with the ball and slipped it right for Liles, who had time on the top of the D to muster a tremendous shot to beat the keeper. The screams and shouts from Hayley perhaps demonstrated how hard we had worked for this winner. The defence were bothered a few times in the dying minutes with Huntingdon trying desperately to equalise. However, South held strong and move into second in the league!

Bek motivated us by telling us we had to beat this team because she knew the coach...who is nice apparently. Anyway, winning was all that was on our minds, but we knew we faced some talented young whippersnappers and so we could not afford to be complacent. We started strong from the push back with our South special putting Anne through on goal in the first 30 seconds to be thwarted by the Uni sweeper. It was going to be a highly charged game. There was a great midfield battle, but no real attempts on either goal until Anne skipped past a few defenders positioned the ball for a reverse stick sweep and a launched the ball into the roof of the net. A superb individual effort and 1-0 to the South. Everyone worked hard to break down the Uni attacks and when the ball broke the midfield always had Emma and Anne available wide with Tash making great runs from deep to pick up the ball. Another break down the right saw a shot from Anne rebound into the path of Tash who obligingly knocked the ball past the keeper. Another goal from Anne before half time gave South a comfortable lead at the break.
We expected the students come back hard so we made sure we did not sit back on our lead. Indeed they did show more intent this time, threatening Cassie's goal, but she was able to deal competently with any shots the students could muster. In general if it passed our midfield the defence were on hand to clear any threats. A break by South resulted in a penalty corner in their favour. The penalty corner line up was altered this week based on Hayley's dream in which she had envisioned a ball from the top of the D being swept in by Emma at the left post. The corner did not go exactly to plan however, a second attempt saw Gemma slipping the ball to Emma who swept the ball into the goal from an almost impossible angle. De ja vous for Hayley and 4-0 for South. Anne then scored her third and South's 5th. But when told she has scored a hat-trick she disagreed as she had not scored them in the same half. However, according to Wikipedia: ""In both field hockey and ice hockey a hat-trick is when a player scores three goals in a game."" A hat-trick it was and it looked like a clean sheet too, until a shot from OUTSIDE the D, left by Cassie, was rather fortuitously awarded as a goal for the students. Consolation I suppose. As frustrating as it was South held strong and maintained composure to hang on to their 4 goal lead.
The match teas were good, lots of chips! We learned that Dutch people do not eat their chips (or indeed crisps) in the form of sandwiches (yet smear mayo all over their sausages!) and that Tash is not a fan of this brand of chicken nuggets. Good face.
Overall an enjoyable game and a deserved win. Quoteth Hayley: ""In the previous game we did not have the edge as we did not function successfully as a unit, this week was all about the team; great hockey, gritty determination and clinical finishes ...woohoo!""

However, when it became apparent that Rutland only had 10 players, it did not take rocket science to predict the likely outcome!
The game started well, with South spending a lot of time in Rutland's half. Good passing between Cat, Jodee, Anne-Isabelle, Daisy and Mel kept the ball moving and ensured possession. A goal was soon scored by player of the match Jodee, hitting the ball firmly past the keeper.
Rutland upped their game and defended well, but South were prepared to battle - the second goal was a result of a scuffle in the D, ending when Chloe drove the ball over the line.
Half time saw some position changes for South and Rutland continued their efforts to attack. They made several breaks but South should have been reassured that with 10 players, Rutland couldn't score for toffee.
Mel scored the third and final goal and despite some rough and tumble tackles, the game finished with a well-deserved win.

With this knowledge we intended to come out all guns blazing to maintain our position in the upper echelons of the table. Gone are the days where South dominated games and could not put the ball in the back of the net. Another emphatic win this week was well deserved and involved some really nice passing moves. It was a pleasure to be on the pitch with one touch passes, leading runs and great support form all players. This week, most significantly, the penalty corners came together. Ely had two attempts on goal the whole game (which were unfortunately for us goals!) and I think it is fair to say the score reflected the play, and in fact it could have been so many more with near misses and one shot hitting the post for South.
The scoring was opened with two Anne-style reverse stick sweeps from Hayley and Gemma after 10 minutes. We were cruising at this stage until the Ely centre forward quite frankly skinned us and got a deflection on her shot that sent it into the roof of Cassie's net. A lesson for South not to sit back on their laurels. 2 more goals from Tash Cox and Gemma Thomas brought the score to 4-1 at half time. Whilst we were dominating the game we had to be aware of Ely's potential on the break.
Gemma's hat-trick goal gave South a comfortable lead, however we were once again thwarted by the speed of the Ely counter attack, bringing the score to 5-2. Yet another (deflected) goal by Gemma just before the final whistle gave South a well deserved win. We worked hard for each other and the hockey itself was beautiful. We came off the pitch pretty darn happy with ourselves.
Thank yous: To Ely for being a really nice opposition and good company in the pub after; to our supporters, including Becca and cameramen Steve and Ian; to Daisy, Helen and Rhiannan for fitting in brilliantly despite never having played with us before; and to Hayley's dad for coming to support at the March game and then not getting a mention in the match report that week, despite Hayley writing it.

In icy cold weather conditions (even with a 12 noon push back!) South started uncharacteristically nervously, but the standard of play was raised dramatically after Bexs first goal 15 minutes through. Pip and Jodee coordinated seamlessly on the left wing, which was matched by Charlie and Mels teamwork on the right. Minutes before halftime the mood became ecstatic following two tense attacking short corners, when AI struck an impressive goal-scoring hit from the edge of the D.
The team continued to pressurise Ely consistently throughout the second half. By communicating well there was a real sense that players knew where their team-mates were and kept possession much of the time, demonstrating a more confident and considerably more goal-hungry attitude than in recent games. Unlike several great runs down the right wing in the first half where South failed to convert, Mels efforts finally paid off when she passed to a perfectly positioned Bex at the penalty spot  one confident sweep and another goal for South. Good support from Cat and midfielders Vicky and Jodee helped to bring about two more goals each by Mel and Bex. The defence were getting ready to put on their woolly hats as they waited for the ball to switch ends, and resorted instead on occasions to star jumps, but reacted boldly when one particular Ely-defender's remarkably strong hit outs reached the other half of the pitch.
Thanks go to Paula for bravely stepping in as goalie and well deserved Man of Match title goes to AI.

Cambridge South, sponsored by PwC, set off at 2ish on the long and winding road to Wisbech hoping that they would maintain their current winning streak. In previous weeks South had not struggled to put out two full teams, but this week was a challenge, and in the end both teams scraped together 11 players, with ill and injured players volunteering their services (forced to play!) for the cause. We had to overcome adversity, and did so in style, the seconds narrowly missing out on a win and the firsts producing the goals for a win.
We hadn't been keeping track of this but Terry pointed out at the coin toss that in fact Hayley has won the toss almost every game, beating the odds, just like South today (too cheesy?)! Spurred on by Hayley's ramblings in the changing rooms about monkeys and kicking bottom, South started out looking the stronger side and much to everyone's surprise took the lead almost straight away through Gemma Thomas' pea-roller shot. Doesn't matter how they go in, as long as they do right? But probably a 1 out of 10 for style and finesse (:-)). A goal nonetheless and South battled through the darkness with Anne rampant on the right wing hammering shots at the Wisbech keeper, and eventually one went in. 2-0, and the South keeper looked frozen.
The rain came down, audibly increasing in strength as the half progressed. Tash was inspirational in the forward line, tracking back to hassle their defence and always providing an outlet for our defence and midfield. Brilliant. Probably as a consequence of Tash's marvellousness, South won a penalty corner... the first attempt resulting in another. This time a straight strike by Hayley gave South a comfortable lead. At half time we were all aware that we were slowing. We wanted more goals from this game, but with no subs, we needed to keep our concentration.
A lot of teams lose their heads at 3-0 down, however, to their credit Wisbech came back fighting. A much more even game ensued. Hayley hit the post and eventually got a second, but a quick break gave Wisbech a glimmer of hope (oh and a goal!). South held their heads up, Tash screaming at us to keep going and we did, Emma finished off a flurry of chances in the Wisbech D from her favourite position on the by line - awesome. However, Wisbech came back and got 2 goals in quick succession. It was a shaky last ten minutes but South held strong to keep Wisbech at bay. 3 hard earned away points mean we stay in touch with Newmarket.
Half way through the season....won 7, lost 1. And a goal:game average of 4.875 (lets call it 5). Storming.

The week before Wisbech had beaten Cambridge Ladies 1  0 so we knew it was going to be a tough game. We won the push back and played into the wind to start this meant we had to push hard to go forwards, giving them a slight advantage.
A missed pass gave Wisbech the first opportunity to attack and they nearly scored but we returned the favour, so all knew it was going to be a tight game.
Both teams had plenty of opportunities to score but the goal drought had started again for South and Wisbech only needed time. We attacked hard and the ball even crossed the goal line from Bex, but no goal was awarded. Instead we had yet another flick, Mel took it and she drove it towards the keeper, who saved it.
Their goal came minutes before half time, Cassie went to stop the ball and stood on it, with Loopy covering the line but the attackers were like hunters after their prey and the ball crashed into the back of the net.
Half time was a welcome relief but the score line was 0  1. Skipper Vicky suggested that we didnt change too much, we just used our width by holding our positions, whilst Mel suggested more communication.
A couple of changes were made, Vicky moved back to CB from CM, Louise moved to LB, Sarah A came off for a while, and Elly went to CM behind Charlie.
Nicky (man of the match) kept making some great runs down the left side and it helped that no one was marking her.
We knew a goal would come and eventually it did with the ball cruising along the goal line before Pip guaranteed the goal.
But the game wasnt over yet  we still had to battle hard to keep Wisbech away and with them awarded a short corner, South were feeling the heat, like sausages crackling over an open fire we burst out and prevented them scoring again.

Eventually, with directions from Gemma, the pitch was found and the team psyche up could begin. It appeared as though Peterborough were once more without a full complement of players, however this was rectified shortly after push back, so South had to readapt quickly. With the sun in their eyes South had many chances in the first half, only to be kept at bay by the Peterborough Keeper. Initially, South looked edgy and without their usual sharpness. The first penalty corner of the game served to settle nerves as Gemma Thomas flicked one past the City keeper.

South settled into their pass and move game and put away 3 more goals before half time, 2 for Emma Clarke and 1 for Anne Keislair. Peterborough got a break through, with a speedy attack (Bek: 'I should learn to keep my legs shut') giving a half time score of 4-1.

In the second half South were more relaxed and the link up play that has been so successful in previous games returned. In particular Anne was very effective on the right wing, with balls fired across the D, two of which were met flawlessly by Emma to give her four for the game! Peterborough lost much of their fight and the shots rained in on their keeper, the post was hit twice, two shots skimmed the posts and Gemma managed to beat the whole Peterborough team from the right sideline to the left side byline, only to be thwarted at the last by the excellent goalkeeper.

Peterborough defended hard to the end and South could not put more past them. Nonetheless, another convincing win moves South into top spot on goal difference.

The team had a few new faces and was missing a fundamental player in their captain Vicky, who was unfortunately absent on the day due. However, Louise stepped into the Captains role for this game with the support of Rupert and Johnny B from the Men's 1sts on the sidelines and later some of the Ladies 1sts.

South were raring to go from the start and linked up well from the beginning with Juliet and AI made some great runs through midfield, linking up with Daisy and Bex who found themselves in space. Some great shots were saved by the opposition's goalie and St Neots started stuffing their 'D' with defenders to make sure no passes got through. With St. Neots playing such a defensive game it looked like turning into a bit of a turkey of a match, with the ball stuck between the halfway line and their 25 as South struggled to break the visitors packed defence down.

St Neots changed players around half way through the first half and this provided them with a bit more pace. However, Lottie, Louise and Sarah blocked most passes before St Neots got into the South's 25 and cleared the ball making some great passes wide to Nicky and Jodee to drive the ball back at St Neots. Even when St Neots made it past South's 25 Paula, who even though this was her first game as sweeper, cleared the ball easily leaving Cassie with little to do but cheer us on. Even though the pressure was all ours, St Neots still managed to thwart our attacks in the D so at half time the scoreline was 0-0.

South had an encouraging team time talk from its supporters and were confident that perseverance was needed as South could out pace St Neots and that eventually a goal or two would come. Bex departed at half time to be replaced by Charlie who moved to Right wing and Daisy switched sides to the left. St Neots started the second half strongly but South pushed on and a short corner was won from a foot in the D. Daisy injected the ball to Juliet who scored South's first goal of the game with a great strike. South pushed back at St Neots and within very little time another short corner was awarded in South's favour. Daisy made a short pass to Jodee who after passing to and from Juliet swept the ball at the goal to be finished off by Charlie, giving a 2-0 score line. South maintained the pressure through to the end of the game resulting in a 2-0 victory. Although it was a frustrating start South persevered to finish 3 points up on 2-0.

A day when we really needed the unavailable changing facilities, after the rain came down. South welcomed back (with open arms) Caroline Dent, who is hopefully back from injury for good (especially after a stunning first half performance).
South won the toss and took control of the game from the off. Caroline looked sprightly on the right with Tash Cox and Emma Clarke hounding the Newmarket defence. South were awarded a number of penalty corners early on, and eventually South capitalised with Emma slotting one in from her favourite position. More pressure from South ensued with the Newmarket defence stretched on a number of occasions. Emma was denied by an impressive goal line clearance and Hayley Sharpe attempted to lob the keeper to no avail as the goalkeeper blocked anything we could throw at her.
Eventually some great link up play between Emma and Caroline gave South a deserved 2-0 lead. Newmarket started fighting back winning penalty corners and using their quick offensive players, soon it was 2-1. Cassie Woodfin was really put to the test and pulled out some show stopping saves. South kept their heads and converted another short through Caroline on the stroke of half time. 3-1 up and it seemed South had the upper hand, but given the history of this fixture South certainly could not sit back.
South continued with some effective passing moves, only to be broken down at the last. Gemma Thomas used her speed and strength to power into the D only to be met by the keeper, who threw herself at the feet of Gemma, yet another chance narrowly missed. South had many chances to put the game out of Newmarket's reach but it was not to be as Newmarket clawed their way back into the game. They gambled by throwing more players forward and it paid off as they got 2 goals back. The last 10 minutes were very nervy. I think exciting stuff for spectators as neither team were willing to give up, nor settle for a point. Both defences were stretched. Special mention to man of the match Julie Sadler who kept Newmarket's most threatening player at bay, with some great covering runs and well timed tackles. A fair result in the end as Newmarket really upped their game in the second half.
Everyone played fantastically, and it was great to have such a well-umpired, well spirited, yet incredibly competitive game.

Yes this week saw Cambridge South 2nds, sponsored by PwC, off to Stamford to take on Market Deeping, with the team were taking no chances in getting to the pitch on time. Good job too as with 45 minutes before push back, the ladies discovered they had in fact arrived at the wrong pitch! Fortunately on the way to Stamford, Captain Vicky Lavis had cunningly made sure she found the other pitch by pretending to get lost (such a clever cat) so no time was wasted getting to the right game.
Despite this however, a car full of players and the ump didnt make it to the pitch in time, so the game started with South two players down and it didnt take long for Market Deeping to exploit their advantage as they went ahead with an early goal. Unfazed, Cambridge responded on the attack, quickly won a short corner and the ball was rocketed into the goal with a superb strike from Juliet Fullwood.
With the game now even, and South back up to 11 players, they were not prepared to go home with a draw. The bad weather and determination from both teams resulted in multiple injuries on both sides with two Market Deeping players having to be subbed off due to a twisted knee and head injury. South kept on battling hard and were disappointed to have a goal disallowed moments before half time for a lifted ball.
Frustration was hitting hard and South went out on the attack straight away in the second half with their next goal coming swiftly from right forward Mel Tinsel, after a well battled fight in front of the goal mouth.
Market Deeping fought back and it took great defensive work and saves from Loopy Lou to keep the score at 2-1. Finally, with excellent link play from defence to midfield, Daisy crossed the ball into Jodee Webb who coolly swept the ball in to make the score line 3-1. Market Deeping werent going down quietly though and caught South off guard to make it 3-2. With only a few minutes left to go, both teams went on the offensive and tried desperately to score a final goal but Souths defence held strong to hold onto their lead.
Full time score 3-2 to South, which makes them the fairies on top of the league table at the Christmas break.

Cambridge South 1sts, sponsored by PwC, overcame a tenacious City of Peterborough side in a League Cup game played at a chilly Leys on Saturday.
South had already recorded two comprehensive league victories over Peterborough (aggregate score 18-1), so could have been forgiven for expecting a fairly easy ride in this match. However, it was quickly apparent that Peterborough were stronger than they had been in the earlier fixtures, and with South also struggling to get going with the coherent teamwork and fluid passing game that has seen them to the top of the Cambs Premier at Christmas, an even first half ensued.
Peterborough emphasised that they were a serious force in the match by taking the lead towards the end of the opening period, when they converted a short corner with a neat routine; the ball was played back from the top of the circle to the injector, who had advanced towards the left post. She swept first time to give Cassie in the South net no chance. South went looking for an equaliser before the break, and had their best chance when forcing a free-hit on the edge of the circle. The take was accidentally lifted, striking a Peterborough defender on the hip, prompting a five-minute stoppage. Possibly due to the coldness of the day making the pitch hard underneath and less compliant, lifted driven balls hitting players would become something of an unfortunate theme.
Having ended the first half in arrears, South would be ahead before the five minutes of the second period were completed. The equaliser came from a short corner, with the ball being switched left to Juliet, who lined up a flick and beat the visiting keeper at her near post. And within thirty seconds of drawing level, South had turned the game on its head. Straight from push-back, Hayley intercepted a pass, broke into the circle and won a short. From the resulting set piece, Hayleys shot was saved, only to roll behind the keeper where Emma and a Peterborough defender battled for the loose ball on the goalline. When the backboard was hit with a resounding *thump* it was obvious that Emma had won the duel.
The rest of the game was played at a frenetic pace, with both teams pushing for further goals. South were hindered by the loss of co-captain Gemma, who was forced from the field when a clearance was accidentally lifted and hit her at full pace plumb on the knee, rendering it unable to bend. Some minutes later, it looked like South might be down to ten, as the other co-captain, Hayley, was left in a heap in the Peterborough circle. The Umpire took a lenient view on the defenders challenge, ruling it a nasty collision but accidental obstruction and therefore only worth of a short corner, which was not a view shared by all spectators (most notably the Peterborough coach, who was vocally unimpressed with her player). Fortunately once Hayley had got some air back into her lungs, she was able to play on. South had one final injury scare, as another driven ball came up from the deck and struck Louisa on her knee. Again, South were able to continue with 11 as the magic spray proved effective in keeping the joint mobile, and with a full complement were able to see out the rest of the match for a 2-1 victory.
The Cambs League Cups are played in two pools per division, with the pool winners meeting in the final. This was the last round of fixtures in Souths pool. They had began the day in second place, three points adrift, so knowing only a win would offer them any chance of a place in the final. South had done their part, but on checking the other results found that the pool leaders had also secured a narrow victory and therefore the final spot. Ah well, not to be, concentrate on the league...
Thanks to Daisy, Juliet and Jodee, who all played well, and ran throughout, even though they already had a game in their legs having earlier played for the 2nds.

Having arrived at the right place, if a bit late due to a detour by both cars, Sarah A braved it in goal for us again and did a fantastic job with some great saves (thank you). Our defence of Vicky, Pip, and Paula kept the midfield busy by constantly passing the ball back as soon as Huntingdon brought the ball over the 25-line. Vicky managed to bypass the midfield on occasions providing forwards Sarah C, Bex and Mel with accurate long passes.
Our midfield players were brilliant and really stopped Huntingdon getting into the match at all. The combination of Juliet, Daisy, Issy and Jodee meant for the majority of the time the ball was in our attacking half!
The goals!
Too many to remember each one, but the first goal was put away by Issy, it was a cracker from the top of the D, she then followed it up with a further three! Jodee was determined to keep ahead of Rupert in the goal king ranking and scored another stunner this weekhell not catch her now!!

Christmas is over and the hockey season resumed with a much-needed friendly before the league starts up. MD arrived with 9 and so Pip and Cat very kindly guested for them (with Pip getting on the score sheet for the visitors- nice one!). South were around a half and half mix of 1st and 2nd team regulars.
South started strongly with an attack that saw Hayley taking on the MD defence and striking the ball into the opposite corner. After a wake up call MD came back hard, equalising with through Pip(South). South defended well, with Vicky sweeping excellently, breaking down Deeping's attacks with efficiency. Louise G was positioned well on the line to block a Deeping shot. Meanwhile, the Gemma 'the rock (I'm not sure I like this)' distributed the ball well, taking advantage of the space Helen and Liles worked for themselves. Gemma made one of those characteristic (ball hogging ;-)) runs into the D and had a shot met brilliantly by the reverse stick of Helen on the opposite goal post to score South's second.
Yet again Deeping equalised, let's say from a penalty corner... but South were not down hearted as Liles scored a great individual goal. Half time and things were pretty good, but there was more to offer and the game needed finishing. Both teams were feeling their festive loads (what?) and the pace dropped, Deeping had more chances but could not convert. Once the ball was out of the South D the attack looked lively with Emma and Liles making great runs. After a great passing move involving lots of players...Hayley managed to squeeze in a 4th goal. Gemma had another pop and this time took the glory with a 5th to seal a win.
Special thanks go to Rupert who sacrificed his match teas to hang out with the ladies (and umpire spectacularly). And the Panton man for putting his grill on.

This week both ladies sides had a game and numbers were a little stretched, with Hayley, Loopy, Vicky and Jodee doubling up, nevertheless we were able to give Ely a run for their money. Despite being a friendly Ely had something to prove having gone down to South 5-2 in the last meeting. Having said this South were the first to settle into the game. The sun made it quite difficult with Hayley performing some unintended acrobatics over an opponents stick and passes going askew. Pressure on the Ely goal soon gave South the lead, with Emma flicking on a pass toward goal for perfectly positioned Claire to slot home.
There were a few nice passing moves, but a lot was hindered by the bright sun. The first half ended with South having the upper hand at 1 - 0. Ely came back with a meaningful reply. Their midfield were strong and fast, connecting well with nippy forwards. They had most of the play and were rewarded with 2 goals to take the lead. South were not down and out..legs were beginning to tire Caroline's battling at the earned her the man of the match, not only breaking down Ely's plays but distributing the ball well to initiate South attacks.

With 1st team ringer Hayley Sharpe kindly volunteering to play for Elys defence (thanks), the girls in attack knew they would have to have their work cut out if they were going to put some goals away today! Each team with only 10 players knew opportunities were available and, with some coaching from Hayley, Ely were prepared to take some chances.
South went out on the attack straight away and were soon rewarded with their first goal which goes to Cat after a hard fought battle between her and the Ely back four.
Ely struggled to break into Souths 25 and with excellent play from the defence and midfield battling for tackles, a superbly crossed ball from the left found Charlie in the D to put away Souths second. Barely 10 minutes into the first half and Cat fired home another excellent goal to make the score 3-0
South then seemed to sit back a bit, much to the delight of Ely who took chance to break through the midfield and put the defence under pressure. Fortunately the ladies were up to the challenge and excellent saves from Loopy Lou combined with great clearances from the backs ensured south kept a clean sheet.
The initial pace and communication from South was waning with frustration and scrappy tackles beginning to edge their way into the game. The match suddenly took on a who can take out Hayley first persona and the concern of injuring one of their own, shared with a motivational team talk at half time, snapped the ladies back into the correct mind set.
The second half saw South going out with their usual attacking flare once again, but Ely werent going down without a fight and the attack were struggling to increase their lead.
However, Souths 4th goal came from captain Vicky Lavis as a result of a well worked short corner routine. Finally, Ely hadnt counted on the Webb goal scoring rivalry and Jodee picked out her spot and nailed a goal home by lifting the ball over the keeper and watching it strike the backboard to take South up to 5-0. (Only a few for Rupert to catch up with now)
Welcome to the new player to our team Sophie who put in a sterling performance for her first time out, along with Paula who is growing in confidence with her defending skills. I think we can safely say that the Christmas cheese and wine has been worked off and South are ready to face Cambridge Ladies next week in what will prove to be one of their most crucial games of the season  Watch this space

However it was not to be as the lack of a South subs took its toll, allowing Cambridge City to fight back in the second half. South began strongly with Hayley seeing a lot of D action only to be thwarted by the City keeper. City struggled to contain the South attack and eventually the break through came when a cross from Hayley was met by Emma at the far post. Much of the same in the first half, however South could not convert penalty corners and so the score remained 1-0 at half time.
We figured City would come out stronger, having regrouped and indeed all of a sudden they appeared to have a lot more belief. They converted their penalty corners which turned out to be the difference between the sides. South unable to distribute the ball effectively out of defence as we went down to 10 ladies. Tired legs (except Ellie H's, who tackled and tackled and brought the ball out of defence brilliantly on a number of occasions) could not muster the ideas and energy required to fight back and so City converted 3 penalty corners in the end and took the win. South should be back to full strength and health next week and will be looking forward to the rest of the season.

In spite of the relentless rain South were determined to play at their best and eager to win this important fixture, which would maintain our position at the top of the table. Pre-match inspiration came from our captain Vicki, and from Hayley and Rupert who gave us all some sound advice. We also welcomed back AI into the side with her new bling stick!
We knew it was going to be a tough game but South started strong and the high effort level from all was clear to see. There were some excellent passing phases and South scored their first goal from a 16 taken by Vicki, followed by a series of excellent passes through midfield between Jodee, AI, Charlie, Daisy and Cat before being niftily slotted away by Sarah who was on hand at the right post.
Our second goal came from a free hit at the top of the D and Cambridge Ladies defence seemed to stop in awe as Jodee confidently found the back of the goal and furthered our score line. Cambridge Ladies came back with even more determination to score and gave our defence a good workout with some excellent saves by Loopy Lou and some great defending by Chloe, Louise, Leila and Vicki.
Unfortunately Cambridge Ladies were able to win a goal back and South were reminded that we still had our work cut out. South quickly came back with an excellent strike from Daisy that their keeper didnt stand a chance of saving.
After the break South came back reasonably confident with a 3-1 scoreline. However, Cambridge Ladies also restarted with renewed determination and scored a second goal fairly quickly. There was some more great movement and passing from South, between the midfield and forwards. We had a couple of opportunities but unfortunately we just couldnt quite turn these opportunities into goals. Cambridge Ladies piled the pressure on quite strongly and with Souths midfield tiring rapidly our defence did a great job of clearing their advances.
However, Cambridge Ladies equalised and started piling even more pressure on, helped by subbing on some fresh legs. With about 8 minutes to go Cambridge Ladies slotted home their 4th goal to win this match and knock us off the top of the league. Although South were disappointed we played some good hockey. The fact that at least half of South earned votes for MoM showed that everyone had put in loads of effort and had worked well together as a team.

After a rousing teamtalk from co-captain Hayley Sharpe, South came out with serious intent. Hayley seemed to be everywhere and got her hat-trick within 20 minutes, courtesy of a strike from the top of the D and a couple of neat flicks that she picked up from rebounds. Being 3-0 up so early settled any residual nerves and South prepared to enjoy the game from then on.
It soon became clear that they either need a bit of target practice or else should petition for the goals to be made a bit wider. Its impossible to say how many balls went inches wide but the build up to each of them was great, with the passing working well right through from defence to attack. Before half time it was 4-0, with Gemma putting one in off a defenders foot. Gemma also had a couple of other chances, including a brilliant strike that ricocheted off the post.
After half time, South expected Huntingdon to regroup, which they did, with more man to man marking. However, it did not stop South going 5-0 up, with Hayley getting her four timer from a pass by Emma. After that, South did manage to let an unlucky goal through, but the rest of the half was characterized by loads more near misses. Liles and Helen produced some great stuff on the right and Ellie Herbert played all three forward positions and did well in each. She deserved a goal for her efforts and for a while thought she had one, only for one of the South forwards to own up that it had hit her foot beforehand.
So the final score was 5-1. South felt they should have had a few more but were justifiably pleased with a great performance that sets them up for the final few games of the season. Hayley deservedly got man of the match for her all round effort, which was topped off by four well-worked goals.

It was our last cup match and we had to ensure we werent beaten by more than 11 goals to make the final
The 2nds team spirit and enthusiasm was in full force in the lead up and we got off to a good start after listening to captain Vickys pre-match words of wisdom. Training had paid off and we used the width of the pitch really well, playing the ball back when necessary. A-I battled away in the middle, frequently intercepting the Wisbech ball and pushing it forwards. Maybe it was the tights under the skirt look that put off the opposition?!
Bex, Mel and Claire played well as a trio up front, with great support from Helen and Jodee in mid-field. Hayley was a great asset to the team as sweeper, meaning Wisbech rarely made it into their Da little boring for Sarah in goal however. But with a rolling sub Pip, Vicky, Julie and Sarah defended well and pushed forwards too  with the ball in our attacking half for 80% of the match.
Claire scored the first goal following a confident strike. This was soon followed by Mel running from the 25 and crossing the ball past the keeper. Helen scored the 3rd goal in true text book stylestanding on the post to deflect a shot from Claire  making it 3-0 at half time. Unfortunately, despite having the majority of the possession, we were unable to score in the 2nd half. There were a number of very near misses, with 4 or 5 shots hitting the post and some very close short corners. Then again, its the near misses that us 2nds are famous for!!
All in all an excellent match. We made good use of the pitch; communicated brilliantly; supported each other throughout and fought hard on the goal. Now bring on the final!!!!!

South were fully aware that the Uni side were likely to pose more of a threat than in the previous match (South won 5-1) this season. Indeed, the Uni's regimental training showed as they worked the ball around us like a well oiled machine. For the first quarter South clung on, showing too much respect for their opposition. A turn around came in the second quarter as South regained their sharpness and began to dominate. Slick passing down the wings left and more confident running gave South many opportunities to take the lead. However, the uni keeper was tested many times, to no avail. Goalless at half time, both teams were clearly not going to settle for a draw.
South continued in the same vein, with Gemma hitting the post, and narrow misses peppering the Uni goal with Helen in particular causing the Uni defence trouble. The Uni held strong and the keeper smothered the ground shots we mustered.
A quick break by the Uni midfield resulted in a pass into the D and a quick goal, taking South by surprise, particularly as it was completely against the run of play. South continued their attacking play, winning a few penalty corners only to be thwarted yet again by a strong defence and good 'keeping.
And so it ended disappointingly 1-0 to the Uni. After the game Hayley was happy with the team's performance, everyone tried their best and it could have gone either way. Two more games left and South are still pushing for that runner's up spot!

We went into it with two previous wins over this team, but knew that at home they would field a stronger line up. We arrived with plenty of time to spare, and sampled the coffee that Stamford had to offer  but minds were soon switched on to the task in hand.
After a good warm up, we were ready to go. Fortunately it wasnt raining horizontally like last time; the sun even broke through the clouds at the beginning of the match. We started well, with pressure on every ball. However, they managed to score an early goal to take the lead from a short corner. Some dogged defending followed by the back three, with Pip (man of the match) playing a key role as sweeper. Loopy made some fantastic saves, but they managed to force another short, which they converted.
We went into the break 2-0 down, but gathered thoughts (and jelly babies) at half time, and were ready to fight back in the second half. Our tactic was to focus on blocking out their strong players from the game, and with some tighter man to man marking, this was successful in the second half. We were much stronger, and with some fantastic runs from deep up the right by Paula and Vicky, and similarly on the left by Jodee, we were really putting pressure on their defence. Unfortunately we couldnt quite manage to find the back of the net, in true seconds style! It seemed like we couldnt score for toffee. However, there was fantastic effort from everybody and some very close chances.
The second half was end to end stuff, and we really started to get slick passing and movement going, with the defence starting the moves, through strong support in midfield with Cat and AI working well together, and with some lovely balls through to the forwards. Out of the blue came another short corner for Rutland, which again they managed to convert. We were facing a tough come back. Heads never went down though and we continued to fight for every ball. Finally the break through came with perhaps the most bizarre goal of the season  it almost happened in slow motion with a free hit outside the D which was duly powered in by AI. Charlie got a touch to deflect towards goal and the Rutland keeper went down but somehow the ball got through her defences and trickled over the line, with everyone looking on almost in disbelief!
Spirits were bolstered and we came at Rutland again strongly, but they proved the better team on the day and a stunning strike from their young left midfield sealed the 4-1 victory. We had some really good passages of play through the match, but just didnt quite convert our chances. A win for Rutland, but a determined effort from the entire team, which saw us definitely in need of sandwiches and flapjacks by the close of play.

Hayley and Emma arrived in Ely a good 2 hours before pushback (to watch the seconds that is), however we were only up to 7 players at pushback time. Thankfully Ely allowed us a 10 minute delay so that the remainder of the team could arrive. So with only a limited warm up, some rantings from Hayley and a longwinded lack of a chant South began their battle to retain second position in the league. With the loss of Ciara to those bumpy row boats Caroline gracefully stepped into centre back. And Daisy filled in beautifully at left back.
And so the battle commenced. South were disciplined and marked tightly. Neither side really conjured an opportunity, until South won a penalty corner and Hayley slotted the ball between the keepers legs to give South a much needed boost. South were spurred on and created many more attacking chances with Claire and Tash narrowly missing and Ellie H and Liles driving towards the Ely goal. A quickly taken free hit outside the D saw the ball deflected onto Hayley's stick, who directed the ball toward goal to give South a 2-0 lead going into half time. The importance of the game meant South could not afford to sit back, Ely needed a win. South started the second half brightly, however one of Ely's talented forwards picked up the ball and some neat passing resulted in a goal, Cassie nearly saving but could only push the ball onto the inside of the post.
Ely raised their game and South continued to play disciplined hockey, but were unable to convert at the other end. Another break by Ely, who had been enjoying more of the possession in the second half resulted in a second goal. In the dying minutes South fought hard seeking the winning goal whilst keeping Ely out, Cassie made a great diving save (as did Caroline at one point!) Gemma provided an outlet for a defence under fire and created chances with her mazey runs. The ball was cleared off the line after an Ely attack shortly before time. A frantic and exciting game with the honours shared in the end.
MOM votes were given to players in all positions reflecting the nature of the game. The draw means that South remain one point clear of Ely and so their fate is now in their hands/sticks... requiring a win against Wisbech next week to claim the runner's up spot... how exciting!

Not only that but the hut we were so looking forward to sheltering in had been blown clean through the astro fence into the field behind, much to the surprise of the cows!
With team Emma and Hayley cheering us on from the sidelines, we kicked off. The first five minutes or so were a little shaky  Captain Vicky was trying out a new formation today, on account of previous matches against this team. We had three upfront (Bex, Mel and Charlie), an attacking central midfield in the form of Cat and AI, ably supported on the wings by Helen and Jodee, and a trio of formidable defenders, namely Louise, Pip and Vicky. With Lou in goal and super-sub Sarah ready on the sidelines, we were putting out a strong team, and experimenting with three in defence, to try and further improve on our earlier matches against this side.
After we had settled down into the new shape, the goals began to flow. A few were stormers, a few were scrappy, but we managed to put the ball into the back of the net TEN times in the first half alone. The few breaks that Ely had, our defence dealt with well, and we were quickly on to the counter attack. We were playing really good hockey, using the width well and stringing together good passages of passing and working the ball into the D. Knowing that the defence were there to mop up any pressure from Ely meant that the forwards were able to attack freely, with the midfield getting amongst the goals as well.
After the break, the Ely goal keeper had a much better half and was denying us with some excellent saves. However, we persevered and managed to add three more to the total, whilst keeping a clean sheet at the other end of the field. Jodee, Bex and Cat picked up hat tricks, with Helen slotting in two, and the, unlucky for some, total of thirteen was completed with goals from Mel and Charlie. Everyone had such a good game that the man of the match was awarded to the entire team!

With the knowledge that Ely were likely to get 3 points, South had to win this game to guarantee the runner's up spot. In addition South would say farewell to Bek, Gemma and Ellie H as this is likely (they'll be back muhahahaha!) to be their last competitive match for them with us. South struggled for players this week, but managed to start with 11.
Suffering from a number of injuries, Emma Clarke assumed a new role as a high centre forward, and successfully caused trouble for the Wisbech defence. South began brightly but moves were broken down as we tried to go through rather than round the Wisbech players. Cassie and the South defence were busy in the first period but dealt with any threats well.
At the other end, Gemma retrieved possession in the centre of the pitch and made a characteristic run for the D, Emma was making a run across goal and Gemma slotted the ball through the defence for Emma to angle her stick and deflect the ball brilliantly between the post and the keeper to give South the lead. It continued to be a niggly affair with stick tackles everywhere.
After half time South came out passing. Tash and Liles worked the ball well on the right, Margot and Ellie kept the Wisbech wingers at bay. An attack down the right lead to a cross into the D that was coolly finished off by Emma. At 2-0 Souths confidence grew and they enjoyed most of the possession. South had success down both wings and a mistake in the defence left Hayley through on goal, a pass around the last defender left Claire with only the keeper to beat, and she did, 3-0. However, Wisbech kept going and Cassie was forced to dive for a save.
Everyone played well to ensure South nicked the runner's up place. MoM votes went to Bek, Hayley, Ciara, Ellie R and Liles, but Gemma deservedly won for all her efforts in the middle, creating attacks and stopping Wisbech in their tracks. Ellie H and Caroline made an appearance in the last 6 minutes. We celebrated a fantastic season. In the words of Ellie Raffan ""We're really great"". Well done to everyone who played for us this season.

Sarah declared Ely is the coldest place on earth; there was some discussion that the coldest place in Ely had to be the railway station. Despite the challenging weather conditions, the players were joined by a number of groupies from the mens teams, and shouts of encouragement from these virile males definitely instilled bravado in the Ladies! There was no question about it: South just had to win this Cup Final!
The match started on time at 1.30pm, both teams keen to get going in the blustery wind. Souths Seconds, arriving early at the venue, had even had time to warm up and psyche-up on Jelly babies. South were determined to win the match, and this dominance was most prevalent in the first half of the game. Energies were slightly depleted by the final quarter, coupled with the needlessness of having to score any more goals against the opposition!
South won the first push back and, with a following wind, made their way up the pitch into the Market Deeping D within the first minute. Souths mid-field and forwards were well spaced; South were playing textbook hockey, which was a pleasure to watch, and the pressure was on. A short corner was awarded to South and AI made a strong hit but it trolloyed over the backline within a metre of the goalpost. Market Deepings hit-out was completely encircled, and South soon took possession again, pushing forward. An opportunistic slip-shot by Mel put the first goal in after 10 minutes.
Market Deepings push-back was then channelled into a long hit into Souths half; Market Deeping dribbled quickly up towards Souths D. Daisys forceful defence kept them out of the D; the ball was cleared from Souths half comprehensively. South ran up the pitch with some clean passes and went for their third chance on goal: Mel passed to Bex but her conversion went just past the goalpost. Another shot on goal saw a Market Deeping defender, facing the wrong way, deflect the ball over the line into their own goal after 14 minutes. The last South player to touch the ball was Charlie; this goal was therefore attributed to her. The Market Deeping defender was distraught and squatted at the sideline in disbelief at this unfortunate quirk of physical forces.
Some tussling on the right wing after the Market Deeping push-back saw a tangle of legs and sticks which sent Lou tumbling, but unhurt. Bex was well placed on the left wing to take up the ball. Play moved into the D again, Mel took a twisting sweep on the ball like a discus thrower, but the ball went past the left post by a couple of metres. A great oooh was let out by the onlookers. A hit-out was intercepted swiftly by South and AI won a free hit just outside the D; this made contact with a Market Deeping defenders foot and South were awarded a short corner. AIs strike on goal was deflected by a Market Deeping stick, and the ball glanced off the pitch. The long corner brought no luck and Market Deeping were able to clear the ball and move up into Souths half of the pitch. Market Deepings first short corner was cleared efficiently by Jodee; the long corner failed to make inroads into Souths solid defence.
Play was in Souths favour again. A strong pass from Mel to Cat presented an opportunity to score but Market Deeping managed to keep the ball out. Another short corner was received by AI but she wasnt able to find a way through the defenders. On hit-outs, Market Deepings defenders were noticeably static; they were however, very fast to break with the ball once in possession. Another frustrating scuffle took place in the Market Deeping D but once again, South werent able to get through their defence. A long corner offered another chance on goal and the ball went into the D twice but South were repulsed. Bex took another chance but she was unable to get her stick to the ball. Mel took another swing but there were too many defenders. A long corner was then translated into a short corner; this brought no joy again and went wide of the goal. The Market Deeping hit-out had little chance of offering them a break in their favour, and some rapid passing up the pitch by South gave Mel and Bex a chance on goal. Bex received a raised ball from Mel and she expertly adjusted her stick to send it towards the backboard just before half-time.
Half time score: Cambridge South 3  Market Deeping 0
Market Deeping gained more of the play in the second half, typical of Souths second halves this season. With three goals in the bag South could have slipped into complacency, but the desire to make this a good one never fully deserted the teams mindset.
Market Deeping broke out hard on the second half push-back but South took control again quickly. Vicky hassled the Market Deeping midfield determinedly. Market Deepings bunching gave South the chance to use either Bex or Mel on either of the wings. Another chance on goal saw South awarded another short corner; 4 or 5 chances to shoot just couldnt be made into a goal, much to everyones frustration. Was this the wind conspiring to keep the ball away from the goal-mouth? There was a short delay as the Market Deeping goalkeeper fixed a broken kicker strap. At the opposite end of the pitch stood Souths goalie, lonely Loopy, resplendent in her canary yellow kit, having seen little play at this stage. This was soon to change.
Play recommenced and Mel made it into the D but couldnt find a way to score. Market Deepings energies rallied and they gained advantage of the game; a massive hit gave them the opportunity for a sideline hit in Souths half of the pitch and a shot on goal passed just 3 metres wide of the post. South picked up their senses and returned to attacking mode, but another break by Market Deeping presented a clear danger to South; their shot on goal was kicked out by Loopy. Market Deepings next short corner failed as Loopy managed to kick the ball away again. Market Deeping returned into the D and an obstruction by Souths defence saw them awarded with another short corner; fortunately Market Deeping failed to score from this. The hit out was intercepted by Jodee who stole away with the ball up the wing towards the half-way line, thence passing the advantage to Souths forwards. A short corner awarded to South was wasted and the ball passed over the backline. Market Deeping switched up the pitch and a shot on goal from a great distance was left to go over the line by Loopy. Everyone was relieved at this sage decision to leave the ball well alone.
Attacking again, South found their way into the D and Mel found the goalmouth exposed and slipped the ball past the keeper to score the fourth goal of the match after 25 minutes. Market Deeping took the push-back and, unflagging, caught South unawares with a strong offence. Souths midfield players quickly returned to assist their defenders. Mel broke with the ball from the half-way line into Market Deepings D but her strike was well defended. Taking the ball into Souths D, a Market Deeping forward took a shot at Loopy who took a great kick at the ball, dispatching it to the 25 metre line. Daisy collected the ball and moved it forwards. Mel crossed the D with the ball and it was swiped into the goal by Bex.
Market Deepings push-back was soon followed by a nasty tackle on Mels foot; she opted to sub-out for a few minutes and I subbed in, to assist in a short corner. No goal was forthcoming and another 2 long corners and another short-corner failed to see the ball go into the goal. Market Deeping defended very well. Mel returned to the pitch and I subbed-off, nursing my Achilles tendon which was protesting after less than 5 minutes on the pitch. Souths final goal was made by Charlie in the last 5 minutes of play.
Market Deeping had an air of urgent desperation upon the next push-back and good stick-skills turned to hacking measures; Daisy was hit twice by a Market Deeping player who was determined to pass the ball through her, and she fell to the ground clasping her knee (site of an old injury). Market Deepings forwards pushed ahead, not hearing the umpires whistle, and took a shot on goal which sent Loopy diving spectacularly across the goal like a Premiership football goalie, arm and stick outstretched. The goal was disallowed [ed  actually, it went wide. And play went back for the previous whistle]; Daisy picked herself up to play the remaining 2 minutes of the game. South made another gallant effort to score but Mels cross was thwarted by a Market Deeping defender. The final whilst was blown just after South took a long corner.
Full time score: Cambridge South 6  Market Deeping 0
After the match, players and supporters made their way to The Fountain pub for refreshments. Sadly, I was informed that one of Market Deepings key forward players was absent from the game owing to a close family bereavement. We should like to offer our sincere condolences to her.

They went with ten players but a strong team and were hoping for a good performance, although there were a few mutterings along the lines of 'I think I'm a bit unfit', especially after the warm up, which consisted of 400m around the nearby athletics track. Captain Tash Cox was heard to remark that the nearest she got to running 400m nowadays was on Wii Olympics.
After a bright start, South were making some good passes and runs but it was St Ives who struck first. Goalkeeper Sarah Massen made several heroic stops in succession but South were unable to clear the D and Saints eventually forced the ball home.
While South got their breath back at half time, they definitely felt they were still in with a good chance of winning the match. Shortly after half time, South were right back into it. The ball came down the right and was switched across the D to Emma, who tried a strike at goal but did not get hold of the ball cleanly. Fortunately for South there was a mix up between goalkeeper and defender and Daisy took full advantage, finishing well.
South took heart from this and put a string of attacks together, one of which ended with Tash doing some great work and fooling the Saints defence, resulting in a 3-on-1 with the Saints keeper. Tash chose to pass to Emma, who managed not to miss the resulting open goal. Having gained the lead, South held out for the remaining ten minutes, with the defence of Ellie R, Caroline and Jodee working hard to keep Saints at bay.
Everyone had a great match, but special mention should go to Tash who must have covered several miles during the match, proving that the Wii is a definite option for those wanting an alternative training regime. Debutant Georgie Hurford also had a great game at RH, along with the rest of the midfield of Liles, Ellie H, and Daisy.

795,"13/09/2008","Cup",6,41,"TBC",8,"Home","6","1","3","1","False","False","False","This was a tough opener for the 2nds as the Ladies leagues have been reshuffled somewhat this year. The Peterborough team were playing in the league above South last year, so a cup match against them looked to be a tricky test at the beginning of the season.
The team has lost a few key players but some great new people have joined up to fill the gaps and the team set out on Saturday to begin their 08/09 campaign in style. This they certainly did, posting a 6-1 win on the day.
The new faces included Tracey, who stepped up to fill the keepers boots, and did a fantastic job in goal. She pulled off some really important saves and was a key member of the defence. Leonie and Carla also played their first match for South and did a great job in defence and in the midfield pushing forwards. We had Jenny and Sam, new recruits to the club, who were dominant in the midfield both playing a defensive role and releasing the forwards with some excellent balls through. Nicky also played a superb game in defence for us. Regulars Vicky in the sweeper position, AI in her customary defensive centre mid, and the forward trio of Bex, Mel and Charlie completed the line up.
South started well with some fluid movement and the first goal soon came from a smooth attack, with Mel slotting the ball home. Then a confident strike from Jenny saw the score at 2-0. We were playing really good hockey with some excellent linking play from the midfield to the forwards. A goal from Charlie completed the trio in the first half. Peterborough did catch us on the counter attack to put one away before half time  going in to the jelly baby break (South's secret weapon!) though with a 3-1 lead we were very pleased with how we were playing.
Unfortunately, we lost Jenny for the second half and battling with ten players proved rather more challenging. However, our defence and Tracey did a cracking job and despite some really good breaks from Peterborough, they could not get through our players. What was also satisfying was when the ball was cleared upfield, a lot of chances were taken. Bex slotted away a goal to start her tally for the season, with Mel adding another to hers with a great strike. An excellent Mel-Bex link up, with Bex putting the ball home, completed the 6-1 victory.
Peterborough put up a good challenge and they were certainly threatening in the second half. It was a highly enjoyable match, played in good spirits against a relatively young side  the highlight was perhaps Mel ending up completely squashing Peterboroughs keeper  one for the photo album! A great start to the season for South. We travel away to Sawtry next weekend for a second cup match  hopefully our winning streak will continue. Our new members fitted seamlessly into the teams style of play and formation and the match today bodes really well for the season ahead.

The game began and we knew Sawtry were going to be a force to be reckoned with. We went 1-0 up after a Bex-Mel special but, as enthusiastic and up-beat as we were, we knew it probably wouldn't last that long! Bex was injured in the first ten minutes and, due to having no subs, had to just stand in the opposition's D for the remainder of the match.
The rest of the team battled on, one man down, with amazing defending by everyone and some excellent saves by goalie Sarah. Our defence of Pip, Loopy, Tracy and Sam had a brilliant game, with Tracy almost doubling up as a second goalie, showing no fear with her stick and head down clearing ball after ball! Pip and Loopy also played fantastically in defence. By half time the score was only 2-1 to Sawtry, who should actually have achieved a score nearer 10-1 with the number of shots on goal they had!
After an upbeat half-time talk by Captain Mel, South had to go back on to the pitch for our defence to get a beasting again! This time a few more shots on goal by Sawtry were successful and the score rocketed up to 6-1. A glimmer of hope appeared as our midfield managed to pass the ball to Mel and she went up the pitch alone to score South's second goal.
By the last ten minutes we had two more injuries: a lifted ball broke Daisy's finger and shortly after Jo got a ball lifted into her ankleby this time everyone wanted to go home!
The final score was 6-2, which was an amazing feat by South and a credit to Mels captaining skills! With subs, a full team and continued determination we will get there

In Loopy's absence the task of goalkeeping fell to the next craziest person on the pitch, which for once wasn't me (Sarah) as Hayley was there to don the pads. Her shouts of ""Keep that thing away from me!"" worked well as within the first couple of minutes South had the lead. A cross from the right was flicked on in the D and Lottie was on hand to slot the ball home on the left post on her debut.
South continued their bright start despite a few Peterborough runs at the defence, and got their second goal not long after. AI won a free hit on the edge of the D and powered the ball in towards goal. A few shots were taken but it was Jenny who finally managed to put one of the rebounds beyond the reach of the Borough keeper. After this Peterborough came back at us and Hayley had to make a few good saves, one of which she skilfully passed to Vicky who would have much preferred she put the ball out of play!
The second half began with a sustained period of pressure from South but despite some good work on the right and a couple of short corners we just couldnt seem to put the ball away, with Mel being unlucky on a couple of occasions. By now the early season lack of fitness and the hot weather were beginning to take their toll and we allowed Peterborough back in it. They had a few chances from a succession of shorts and I'm very glad I invested in a good pair of shin pads last season after their striker really got hold of one of the hits! Late on one of their forwards gave the defence the slip and Hayley made her save of the match with the help of a diving J who pushed the ball away from the goal and over the back line after it had come off Hayley's foot and stick.
Man of the match fittingly (as this was her last match till after Christmas) went to AI, who put in her usual dominant display in defensive midfield.
In the end, a good start to the Ladies' IIs league campaign  hopefully we can continue our winning ways against Sawtry next week and pick up fewer injuries than last time we were there

Although fairly even in the early stages, South couldn't quite maintain enough possession to settle themselves and the linking between the midfield and front three never quite clicked, despite the committed running of Tash up front.
Ely eventually made their pressure count about halfway through the first half and by halftime the score was 0-3 in their favour.
The second half became steadily more of a rearguard action for South as injuries forced them to adjust formation repeatedly and the lack of substitutes told as legs wearied. It took some heroics from Cassie in goal and good team defence to restrict Ely to two goals from short corners and an unlucky bobble that was swatted home from short range.
Hopefully South can put up more of a fight in the rematch at Ely.

South kept working and were unlucky with a few attempts on goal just going wide.
Overall a good team performance and an enjoyable game despite the scoreline.

835,"25/09/2010","League",2,121,"15:30",7,"Away","1","2","0","1","False","False","False","In a bid to confuse and surprise the opposition, Cambridge South II started their league campaign against St Ives III in the novelty formation of 4-5-1. With the team fired up and ready to go, we came out of the blocks all guns blazing: incisive passes from Chris Heron (who kindly joined us from the Is) and good runs up the line by Bhav Virdi and Tim Clapp resulted in frequent incursions into the home D; surely it would only be a matter of time until we went all the way and put the ball behind St Ives decidedly large and skillful keeper?
Soon, however, it became clear that confusion was not limited to the opposition. Especially when Chris had to step off the pitch with an unexpected injury, the mid-field duo of Sanjay Agarwala and Ron Oren somehow managed to leave a gap the opposition could drive a guided bus through. Good things Andy Passmore played the role of Cambs county council and kept the busroute firmly closed... With St Ives not really threatening and only winning a short thanks to keeper Shahbaz Ali getting lost and kicking the ball outside his own D, it felt against the run of play when the home teams striker slipped away from his marker and tapped in a goal at the far post. 
Reverting to the old, familiar 4-4-2 during half-time, with Tristen Knight joining Rob Barton up front to harass the St Ives defence shouldve made things easier. It wouldve even, if the umpire had been so kind as to wait for our whole team to be on the pitch before starting the half. With half the visitors team still putting away their water bottles, its hardly a surprise that St Ives started in a better fashion than us. Reluctantly, we have to admit they did textbook hockey: first incursion into the D was converted into a short and duly dispatched. 2-0 and South was staring defeat in the face.
Not for long, though. Within minutes, South had found its feet and set up camp in the home half. When play broke down just outside the St Ives D, the indefatigable Bhav drove the ball into the D, burst past a defender or two and sweetly struck the ball straight into the far corner. Cunningly, Rob distracted the goalie with an attempted tap-in, but gallantly conceded that the only thing he tapped was the goalie himself. 2-1 and South was back in the game. 
With 25 minutes to go, play was well and truly kept at the St Ives end of the pitch, frequently cramming all but one player into their end. With backs Ian Glover and Tom Anns joining into the fray, attacks from South came thick and fast down either wing. Several textbook-situation were engineered: 3 on 2s, 3 on 1s, even a 1 on 1 with the goalie; but Souths traditional weak point showed itself again: we just couldnt convert.
The final whistle found a relieved St Ives snatching a win from a rather disappointed South. But the team has nothing to be ashamed of: they played well, especially in the second half, and were very unlucky not to come away with one point to start the season!","Men's 2nds lose away to St Ives","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

That didnt last long as Manu soon informed the acting Captain that he had done his back - however many of the team, and certainly the opposition, were not aware of this as his performance fully disguised this injury.

South began showing their intent to stick to a short passing game with some nice play all over the park stringing passes together. Shortly however Elys speedy right wing burst through from the half way line, running an inside channel that beat everyone and slipping the ball inside for a neat Ely finish.

Both sides were passing nicely and competing in midfield, but Ely were the more incisive:  A loose pass in midfield was made the most of by Ely as they drove into our D, and winning a short corner that they converted. Another skilful run from one of their more forward players took him into the D where he somehow evaded what seemed like an easy tackle to make by Sanjay, before hitting the ball with a sight lift over the diving Shahbaz and into the net to make the score now 0-3..

Cambridge however kept composure - it was only small errors that seemed to have been punished and cost them, rather than across the park domination. Dave Monk and Ian G in defence were making sweet tackles and keeping Ely at Bay. Meanwhile Manu and Tom Anns continued to distribute from the full back position. Tom Anns day took a turn for the worse as he strained in pursuit of the speedy Ely right wing, and tore a muscle painfully that saw him leave the park for a while, before returning to stalk (hobble around) the opposition goal.

Nearing the end of the half a pass across midfield to Tom Watson found him in plenty of space, from where he had time to send a perfectly weighted and angled though ball flying into the D for Rob Barton to chase. The Dog (now) in the D latched on and seeing the onrushing keeper masterfully dragged the ball across to round him. However as he was completing his side step with the open-goal beckoning his trailing leg was taken by the keeper. A  penalty flick was awarded, to which Bhav stepped up and duly converted with an expert finish to the bottom-left that left the keeper no chance.

Buoyed by the upturn in scoreline South went into the second half believing and knowing that more was possible. Tim Clapp now in left midfield provided strong attacking support, linking up well with Richard Claes at left back. South were indeed beginning to dominate proceedings around the centre of the park, having improved their shape and structure at half time, with Tom Watson in dynamo mode. 4 short corners, as compared with 0 for the first half, were won, but unfortunately none were converted. 

Ely were tiring whilst South seemed to be getting stronger. Souths roving attacks made the most of Tom Anns superlative movement to find him unmarked in the D 5 yards form goal. In true time honoured defenders tradition he took a huge wind up and made a sweet hard connection with the ball. - Unfortunately not towards the goal ;) 

Tom found himself in the same situation not long after, and with the same result. - However acting captain Sanjay was pleased he was getting into these goal-scoring positions, utterly bamboozling the opposition with his total inability to move.

A long corner from the right hand side, with lots of players in close support to break up and move the opposition ring around, led to a fantastic ball slap-hit hard into the D from Rob Barton, travelling along a clear channel until finding Rich Claes roving up from left back who swept home skilfully first time against the backboard. The report writer has been requested to write here that, Rob Barton actually passed and allowed someone else to score. It was indeed a fine pass!

2-3.

Unfortunately for South there was not enough time left on the clock, and Ely breathed a sigh of relief as the final whistle blew.

South can be proud of their collective attitude and improving team play which will no doubt get themselves up the table in due course, and a win against these opponents is targeted in the return fixture.","Men's 2nds lose to Ely City","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

The team were in confident mood after recent results, however the first 5 minutes saw us perhaps overconfident!  Coach Colins advice on defending - urging us to leave plenty of space between oneself and the attacker, dummy-jabbing to keep their heads down, and perhaps merely channelling them, seemed to be ignored (or never heard). Stepping so close to the attackers let them turn us every time as we went diving in for every tackle, making stick tackles and giving away free hits and short corners. 
The Cambridge midfield and attack were largely spectators as the Pboro attack continued to run at the South defense. After at least 4 short corners in the first 5 minutes Pboro finally converted one.
Then South decided to play properly. Really properly. (Perhaps it helped that we got to start play from the centre circle for the first time in the match).
Good passes were made to our own players, Rich was making his runs, and a short corner was won quickly.
New big man Mariano stepped up to strike, the keeper saved - the rebound falling to Manu. Manus aerial shot was palmed down by the keeper ....to Rob, currently prematurely celebrating with arms in the air, who took hold of his stick again, to wind up and hit the ball through the gap into the backboard. 1-1
Pboro seemed disappointed that the seeming 10-0 that it looked like they were headed for on the basis of the first 5 minutes was not going to occur. They had no answer to the verve, energy and skill of Cambridge, who were now tenacious and more skilled in the tackle, and rampant going forward. A fine move down the right hand side involving Ian, Bav, and probably some others too, resulted in the ball played to Rich on the right hand side of top-D, from where he slipped past the right hand side of the defender trying to block him and seeing a number of options to pull back to chose Ian, rampaging all the way up from right back who swept home emphatically all in one flowing movement.
The Pboro coach was screaming many things at his players - their whole team shaken and being outplayed. Calm structured defending now from the unit at the back of Ian, Andy, Mariano and Ron snuffing out attacks and feeding Souths own attacks. South were playing mainly in the opponents half, but a third goal was not forthcoming.
Half-time . The second half was largely a story of stopping the attacks of a largely frustrated Pboro side, who came close a few times and fashioned many shorts which they could not convert, but South had their chances too as Pboro did not seem that solid at the back. A move through the centre led to Tom Watson, now playing at centre forward after picking up a somewhat immobilising knock, slipping the ball left through the D to Sanjay, who squared for Rob 2 metres from goal. The keeper went down flat, but with the net gaping for the simple lift over the keeper, Rob seemed to have contracted defenders disease this week, and with plenty of time for a big wind up smacked it into the prostrate keepers legs.
The drama continued - a ball given away by Sanjay from a sideline hit on the left led to a swift Pboro counter attack as South seemed pushed up very high. Somehow they squeezed a slowly rolling ball into our goal to equalise. A final short corner (no9?) was awarded to Pboro at the final whistle, and Souths defence heroically lined up against their 10 men, out psyching them and forcing them to miss yet again.
Both sides left slightly frustrated with the draw, but Cambridge are buoyed by the fact that they were once again equal to one of the top teams in the division, this time got points to show for it, and most importantly put in a great performance that we are collectively pleased with and that continues our weekly progress.","Men's 2nds draw with Peterborough","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Shahbaz The Goalie got an ankle injury on Thursdays training and was unfit for the game, Ron The Captain didnt have internet to organise the team, Sanjay The VC went to play for M1 and Ian went to play for the M3s. The issues didnt finish because when the team reached the Cambridge University pitch, they found out that the match would start 25-30 minutes late because the previous match was running late. It was getting dark and cold when South stepped on the pitch. 
We all know that these things do not matter when the men in green stepped on the turf. 
Harry was our new keeper for the match and Kev Rowland was playing his first match for M2s after a long absence. Kev wanted to make a big impact and Ron obliged when Kev was sent up front to play as a striker with Rob Barton. 
The first 2-3 minutes of the match was all St Neots as they got 2 penalty corners, one of the penalty corner strikes just went past the goal post. South was lucky to survive this onslaught and built their game from there. 
The midfield was working well with Rich Claes, Manu, Tom & Bav Virdi pressing forward and making good opportunities for Kevin & Rob upfront. 
In one such move Rich ran with the ball for 30 meters and passed it to Rob who put the ball in Kevs shooting range and Kev sounded the board with ease. 10 minutes gone and South was 1-0 up. 
Manu & Tom were very good in the midfield and were passing wide to Rich (left mid) and Bav (right mid). One of the moves from central midfield gave the ball to Bav (right mid field) and he combined with Andy Passmore (right back). Andy hit the ball into the D to Rob, who again did not strike but actually passed to his fellow forward and Kev scored his second goal in 15 minutes after 4 months rest. What a comeback! 
15 minutes gone and South was 2-0 up. 
St Neots looked like they found some magic potion and pressed really hard at the South defence. They were entering the D but the South defence of Ron-Dave-Mariano-Andy held tight. South was not able to penetrate the St Neots D in the last 15 minutes of the first half. 
In the 32nd minute of the first half, Bav had a tussle with the St Neots player and with umpire Steve standing just 5 meters away Bav thought of swinging his stick at the opponent. Steve obliged Bav by giving him a yellow card and sending him to the sin bin. Typical Bav! 
Ron gathered his troops together in the break and wanted his team to press harder and gave a good earfull to Bav which he deserved. 
The second half started with South playing 10 men for first 10 minutes. 
St Neots got one back when it was 3 on 1 and although Harry in the goals tried his best, he was a silent spectator. 2-1. 
With South having 11 men finally after 10 long minutes, they pressed forward again. South got a penalty corner and the hard work put in on Thursday finally showed when a pin point perfect insertion from Tristen and a perfect rocket hit from Mariano resulted in a goal. South was 3-1 up. 
South were not finished yet and the combination of Manu & Tristen were working wonders in the central mid field. Manu in particular was having a great game and looked like he could run away with the Man of the Match. But he had different plans. South got a free hit outside the 25 meter line and Manu took a self pass and with all his power slapped the ball into the D. The ball never reached the D because it hit Rich on the way and hit him where-it-hurts-a-man-the-most. Manu later got the Lemon of the Match for that and Rich didnt play any part in the match after that incident. 
Mariano in defence was having a very good game and started a move which resulted in the fourth goal. He gave a long ball from the 23 yard line to Rob in the attacking half, who passed it to Tom in the D. It was 1 on 1 with the keeper and The Tom Watson never misses those. South was 4-1 up, with 6 minutes to go. It was a different experience today for Rob, as he had 3 assists for Souths goals but ended up not scoring any. Rest of the game was played in the mid field. 
Final whistle! 
Kev Rowland had a great comeback game. Mariano at the end of the match was correct to say that We could have won by 5 or 6 goals. A good victory for South and 3 points in the bag. Ron The Captain was a happy man with the result.
Tom Watson was voted the Man of the Match for his good all round display in the mid field and an excellent goal.","Men's 2nds claim a super win against St Neots","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

After a disappointing loss in the first game between these two sides at the start of the season this was a welcome result. But Souths second men did their best to snatch a draw from the jaws of victory and could (and maybe should) have won this game by seven goals instead of one.
With the unusual luxury of multiple subs and the captain acting as manager from the sidelines, South  started this game in positive form with some nice pass and move hockey. This was quickly rewarded with pressure on the St Ives goal. Unfortunately Rob B decided to test the goalkeepers judgement of angles, this apparently involves bouncing the ball off the pads three times in a row then rolling it wide of the goal. This pattern was repeated again shortly afterwards. In fact the story of the half was one of lots of pressure but good saves or the ball not quite falling to convert this into goals. Even when the goal did come it bounced around off goal keeper and defenders' blocks before being prodded in by Tim.
St. Ives did have some pressure but never looked that threatening from open play though they sent a shot whistling past the post on occasion. Richard should have doubled the lead shortly before the half when Rob was fouled getting past the keeper; the umpire blew for a short corner just as the ball reached the end of Richards stick in front of an open goal. Half-time South 1-0 up and feeling more goals and the game were there for the taking.
In the second half the game began to open up as South's younger and more mobile midfield began to find more spaces between the St Ives lines, with charging runs from Richard, Tom W, Mariano and Tim all driving into the D. The finishing got more clinical with Richard getting his just reward popping in the second goal.
Unfortunately this lead was short lived as St. Ives came straight back, won a short corner and converted it via a slip back to the injector. Undaunted South kept pushing and were rewarded when Dave M thundered a ball into the D from near the halfway line and the Ives keeper tapped it out to Nish who couldn't believe his luck and tapped it in with aplomb. 3-1 with 15 minutes left.
Shortly after Tim decided to ignore the captain/managers half-time edict of pass dont run with it. However since he hit an unstoppable shot into the bottom left corner from the top of the circle even Ron was forced to admit it wasnt always a bad thing to do! 4-1 up, 10 minutes to go.
Maybe the thoughts of how many? had got South slightly excited at this point. Maybe the novelty of having subs had finally confused everyone too much about their positions but suddenly St. Ives found that they could get the ball to players on the wings who couldnt have been more alone if they were Ricky Ponting at an Ashes victory parade. An opportunity they didnt spurn as a cross was tapped in at the back post to make it 4-2, five mnutes to play. Repeating the same formula a couple more times suddenly it felt a little nervous for South as they came under more sustained pressure than they had at any early point. St Ives converted this to a short, though the final whistle blowing before it was taken meant the result wasnt in doubt, but it was converted to give the visitors extra consolation.","Men's 2nds beat St Ives","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

In the first fixture, Pboro just pipped South to the win, mostly through judicious use of a slick short-corner routine.  The boys in green were keen to get Pboro back for this injustice.
With every team in the club struggling for numbers, the team found itself supporting the 4s and had to start with Phil Crowhurst, Ian Glover and Simon Jelley having played a full game already. Maybe a strategy the team should employ more often: very rarely have we seen such an energetic start to a game. With pin-point passes from midfields new recruit Alex Stafford and keen runs from the likes of Rich Claes, Rob Barton and Jelley, it wasnt long until South found itself in Pboros D; even skip Ron Oren managed to get a 1-on-1 with the home goalie (a chance he duly fluffed). Still, the Pboro defence held firm, even if they couldnt break Souths iron ring.
The change came when South started winning short corners. After Dave Monck hit the rushing defenders rather than the goals, the runners turned a little less keen. This tempted Ron to try a strike himself; although the ball went far wide of the mark, Rich was on hand to retrieve the ball and ping it back into the fray, where Alex was waiting and hit a sweet rising strike just above the backboard. With a touch of good fortune, the umpire accepted Souths goal. 0-1.
Whether goaded by this misfortune (from their point of view) or not, Pboro didnt take this lying down. In fact, they had the best come back ever: within a minute, they made it into Souths D. With a cross deflected by a striker away from both goalie Shahbaz Ali and the defenders, it fell to the second striker to push an easy  goal home. South might have had the superiority on the pitch, Pboro were clearly up to scratch with the finishing. 1-1
But nothing could stop the South juggernaut. With the midfield trio of Alex, Phil and Manu Bhardwaj constantly changing shape, the home side couldnt get past them or stop them going forward. Good use of plenty space on the width and continuing running up front made South the more dangerous side. Soon enough, Rob found himself in the opposition D, where he was forced onto his weak side, Pboro clearly not knowing thine enemy. Never one to pass up an opportunity, Rob waited until the angle got ridiculously tight, performed his trademark drop, roll and shoot - into the far corner. 2-1. South was in the ascendency at half-time.
Allegedly, the home captain set his team a challenge at half-time: hed rather lose 4-1 than not try to win (words he would come to rue...). Credit where credits due: the home side certainly came out strong again. For a few minutes, play was completely reversed, with Pboro camped out in Souths 23. It was only the solid defending of Souths defence, with notable gritty tackling by Tom Anns and impressive tracking back by the midfield, that stopped the home side from equalising. Still, it was a relief when South starting getting their feet again and slowly pushed Pboro to their side of the pitch. The match was sealed with a champagne move: a beautifully weighted pass by Dave released Manu, who had time to complain about the need to run before chasing off after the ball. Having duly retrieved the ball on the other side of the pitch, a simple slip to Alex put him in prime shooting position. 3-1. 
Chasing the game, Pboro had to throw everything forward. Luckily, Souths defence stayed awake and thwarted Pboros advances; a classy last ditch tackle by Andy Passmore standing out as an example for a next generation of suicidal hockey players. On the other side of the pitch, there were acres of space available for Souths romping attackers. When Jelley made good use of the space and was serviced with a pin-point pass (again), he was unlucky not to notch up a goal for himself. His strike was enough, though: picking up the rebound, Rob coolly looked up and flicked the ball past the scrambling defenders. 4-1.
Although both Rob and Alex were accused of jug-avoidance when they missed absolute sitters, the final feeling for South was one of well-deserved elation. Compared to the previous match against this side, it was a marked improvement; not just in the final result, but also (and more importantly) in the way the team played. If ever there was proof that playing as a team and working for each other gives good results, this is it. As Pboros captain gallantly admitted afterward: this South team was the best that hed played against this season. Ours is now the challenge to keep up this form.","Men's 2nds beat Peterborough","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

The team started brightly enough, pressing high and making good inroads into the visitors final quarter in the first few minutes. Although Long Sutton wasnt getting much of the game, South found it hard to convert their possession to goals. Soon the first injury struck: skipper Ron Oren found out his hamstring wasnt up to running and had to sub himself off. It must have been coincidence that the first goal fell within a minute of this change: while Ron was theatrically limping around the pitch, Alex Stafford surged into Suttons D and, with whats turning into a trademark reverse stick shot, deposited the ball into the far corner. Unfortunately for Alex, the universe (or maybe Long Sutton) took a dim view at his scoring ability and paid him back with a direct hit on the shins; wearing only tiny shinguards, he was lucky to come away with bruises and a scraped knee only...
Most of the match followed a set pattern: while South had most of the play, they couldnt seem to find the goal again. Long Sutton was never completely out of the game, but neither did they threaten Souths goal much. The visitors strongest weapon, their speedy right-wing, was expertly neutralised by solid tackling of Tom Anns and energetic tracking back by Rich Claes. Eventually, an elegant team move of 3-touch hockey found Tim Clapp free at Suttons post; not even bothering with 3 touches, Tim slapped the ball home immediately to secure the win.
The last moments of the game saw a few more bruised bodyparts: Alex found the universe hadnt forgiven him yet and suffered another blow to his shins; Suttons captain got an earful in return. To cap things off, Bhav Virdi lost control of the ball momentarily and parked it, at short range, into a Sutton defender - who bowed out of the match with an even more pronounced limp than Rons. Undoubtedly, Long Sutton will long rue the moment that South broke its dry spell against them!","Men's 2nds beat Long Sutton","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Captain Ron was travelling with the team although he had a bad hamstring.  Rest of the team looked quite fit. Dave Monck lost his way and took us into a residential area for retired people.

The match started at a brisk pace where the Market Deeping side didnt look like they were 11th in the league table. They were passing well and some of the runs from their flanks resulted in early penalty corners against South. Shahbaz sprung quick into action and his reflexes saved South from the first 10 minutes of the Deeping onslaught. The penalty corner threats were averted and South started settling down. South defence under Dave Moncks command looked solid with Manu, Ian Glover & Tom Anns standing as a wall.
Tom Anns & Rick Cleas specially were combining quite well on the left flank. Alex & Tom Watson in the central midfield were moving the ball to the flanks and to Rob & Tim in the D. Bav Virdi got a green card for a stick tackle in the first half (which would not be his last card of the match). The last 10 minutes of the first half was all attack by South, where there were couple of open scoring chances but the ball just didnt cross the goal line. Tom Watson was given a green card because he stopped the ball with his stick above the shoulder.
The first half ended 0-0. Dave & Ron changed the plan and it was decided that Dave Mock would pass more from the 16 yard starts and if we have to score we need to use our pace against Deeping. 
This was correct as South got their first goal in the 5th minute of the second half. Tom Watsons cross from the left found Rob Bs stick and sharply deflected the ball into the goal. 1-0. 
The second goal came soon after when Alex and Rob combined and Rob did a clinical finish. Rob was in form and looked like he could get a hat-trick very soon. 2-0 to south after 15 minutes of the second half. 
Although Souths defence was solid, Dave Moncks knee wasnt. He twisted it and was moved from deep defence to the free striker up front. This resulted in a 3rd goal when South counterattacked. Alex got the ball from Manu, made a 20 yard run, gave a good pass to Rob B, who then passed it to a free Dave Weak Knee Monck, who made no mistake to sound the board. 3-0 to South and Daves first field goal since his A levels.

Rob Barton has had more assists this year than the number of goals he has scored. 
Dave Monck was replaced by Ron Oren upfront. Ron played in his trousers and a XXXXL Moncksaurus Tshirt. That could have easily given him the lemon. But more lemon rewarding acts were to come. 
Souths attacks were not finished yet. They got a penalty corner when 7 minutes were left in the match. A very good insertion from Ron Oren was stopped by Bav Virdi, he did a cheeky pass with his sticks handle to his right (which in all laws of FIH was supposed to be legal). The umpire blew the whistle saying I dont like it. Bav Virdi went mental; he started arguing with the umpire and was shown the yellow card for shouting and arguing with the umpire. This also gave him the LOM. From what we have heard his role model is Ricky Ponting. 
The match ended with South having another clean sheet. Tom Watson was rewarded the MOM for his good display in the central mid field. 
Ron was a very happy man with South M2 reaching the magical figure of four wins on the roll but he reminded us of no complacencies, as we play the league leaders Ely next week. Good Luck South!

Gamely rising to the challenge, the team started out brightly, with the midfield trio of Rich Claes, Tristen Knight and Russell Johnson (on loan from the 1s, while recovering from a recent cold) harrying Ely sufficiently to keep play well away from the home goal. Scant minutes had passed when Tristen played a pin-point pass to Rob Barton, whod slipped behind the defence, took the ball around the goalie and calmly buried it into the gaping goal.
As the home side kept up the pressure, its wasnt too long until the lead got doubled. A South short corner saw Mariano Rosenzvaig and Bhav Virdi test out the pads, before Richs strike was deflected in by Rob - always mindful of Goal Kings. As the half proceeded, Ely finally found some composure and started to exert some pressure of their own, winning a few short corners. Conceding nothing more than a bloody lip for Ron Oren, South found themselves going into half-time with a healthier lead than the skippers face.
In the second half, South again were the faster team out of the blocks, taking the game immediately to the visitors defence. This time, when the ball fell to Rich after a slightly sloppy moment in the Ely D, he dispatched the ball far enough from Rob to get the goal himself. To Elys credit, they did not crumble, but actually stepped up their game and started to press South back. Soon enough, their efforts paid off with a goal of their own: 3-1 and Ely fancied themselves back in the game.
As South attacked again, straight from push-back, an umpires decision was contentious enough for one of the visitors to voice his disapproval. Being shown a yellow card, he - somewhat foolishly - carried on in the same vein, only to see the card turn red - the first one most players ever saw. Feeling hard done by, this only spurred Ely on, though: the remaining 10 fought like lions to salvage something of their day. Credit where credits due: not only did they keep South away from their goal, they even managed to get a second score and fancied themselves back in the game.
Eventful as the game had been, it wasnt over yet. One man and one goal up, South found itself surprisingly embattled by a resurgent Ely side, when their own ranks faltered. Marianos hot South-American blood flared up in the guise of a few unwise remarks, which earned him a card of his own (mercifully the lighter coloured one). Ely, however, decided that numerical equality was not to their liking and retaliated with lip of their own and a second player forced to admire the goal from behind; which he promptly attempted to refurbish with his stick. As the final minutes ticked by, South managed to hold on to their lead, and tempers, to get away with the three points.
Although at times too close to comfort, it was a good win in the end. Once again, South showed that they can play excellent hockey and, more importantly, that they have the grit to battle when its needed. With one rival dispatched of, the team will be looking to keep this form in upcoming matches and notch up a few more points. ","Men's 2nds beat Ely City","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

In light rain it was South who started the brighter, parting the clouds with a couple of quick strikes.  Alex Stafford found the net on four minutes via a strong, classy finish after nice work from Rich Claes up the left flank.  Alex turned provider six minutes later when he weighted a through pass to striker Rob Barton who was on target to slip the ball under the oncoming keeper.  The score-line might have been further broadened in these initial exchanges courtesy of strong attacking play, in particular from wide men Bhav Virdi and Ron Oren, and a handful of wasted penalty corner opportunities.
At two-nil South, it seemed, took their collective feet of the gas and the game slowed to a gentle cruise.  Despite this the umpires were to chalk up a trio of further efforts before the break.  The first of which came from Bourne as a lurking forward was on hand to tap-in from close range after South failed to properly clear their decks during a rare foray by the hosts.
The threat of an equaliser firmly bashed Souths sleepy heads together and the wake-up call was answered by Ian Glover on twenty minutes.  By this point a rejuvenated South had intensified their efforts although speed of play was far from that of the opening encounters where their dominance had reigned.  Good incisive hockey from Tristen Knight led to Alex squaring the ball in the D for Rob to flick on and Ian to smash home to restore the greens two goal lead.
Like a dog in season, the home side were not to be shaken off and their opener was soon followed by their second.  A through ball pierced the heart of Souths defence and trickled between three defenders before the lurking forward knocked home at the back post.  Soberingly it was three-two.  There was clearly still a game to be played!
With ten minutes to go in the half Tom Anns, who had kept their lively right winger in check, earned himself a yellow card for playing the ball above shoulder height.  A contributing factor to the infamy which was to follow that day for Tom...  Fortunately, South were able to stand firm during the minutes of reduced headcount and the umpires whistle sounded out soon enough to put an end to the first period.
Half time and three-two to South.
The second period continued in similar vein to that which ended the first.  Below par too-ing and fro-ing from both sides begot an indulgent and relaxed feel.  Precious time drifted by and Souths keeper, Shahbaz Ali, was gladly not seeing too much of the ball.  The visitors midfield and defence were incinerating Bournes meteor showers in the upper atmosphere.  Andy Passmore looked like he was Andy Impassable and sweeper Dave Monck was reading the attacks and distributing the ball well.  The one or two fires which did break through were mostly stamped on at source.  But Bourne didnt read the script and unceremoniously scored again to unnerve their opponents.  This time a well-taken penalty corner saw the ball planted in Souths net and the score unjustly standing at three a piece.  Yikes!
Still there was plenty of time for South to earn all three points in a game in which they felt they always had the upper hand.  On fifty-five minutes, having picked the ball up from just over the centre line, Rich Claes coolly dribbled through half a dozen players before calmly passing the ball into the bottom corner.  Yes!  This piece of individual skill went some of the way towards his Man of the Match award.  It looked to be the winning goal and Bournes heads dipped in resignation.
Ten minutes to go and South now had their belief back.  Ian and Ron were pushing aggressively forward, squeezing the game into one half and enabling those in front to turn up the heat on the Bourne goal.  Still the game wasnt comfortable until South saw daylight once more.  Rob wrapped up scoring five minutes from time reacting quickly after efforts from Tim Clapp and Alex were parried by the home keeper.  A poachers finish.
There was just time for a Bourne player to be shown a yellow card for repeated dangerous tackling before the final whistle drew the curtain on an entertaining game.
Full time and five-three.  South just about escaped with all three points.
Man of the Match went to Rich for another solid and energetic performance.  His stunning finish glistening as the cherry on top.  Votes for Lemon of the Match were neck and neck between Tom and Bhav before eventually going to Tom.  It wasnt for the yellow card incident, nor was it for the obvious vote fixing attempt (all those in the early departing car voting for Bhav!), but it was actually the pre-match pitch-side tinkle that swung it.  Afterwards, one of the umpires was quoted as saying: ""Peeing in the corner does it"", and who are we to argue with the umpires?!  Bhav take note!  Incidentally both umpires controlled the game well.
An enjoyable game for all involved, played in fantastic spirit despite the appearance of two yellow cards.  South demonstrated in patches that they are capable of neat, fast flowing attacking hockey and committed tackling.  However, they must be under no illusion that next weeks visit of top-of-the-table Peterborough will provide a far stiffer challenge.

What will happen in this epic battle? When these teams met previously in the season, South managed to shake off their disappointing start and won a hard-fought draw; would they improve on this performance in the rematch?
True to recent form, South started the game brightly, with forwards Rob Barton and Tristen Knight harassing the Peterborough build-up from the very start and especially the centre-midfield duo of Manu Bhardwaj and Mariano Rosenzvaig contributing to the attacks. Although play was more in Pboros half to start with, it was the away side that opened the score, when their right wing managed to get part Souths Tom Anns. Goalie Shahbaz Ali saved the initial effort, but the attacker beat the defence to the rebound and tapped in at short range.
To Souths credit, their heads didnt drop - instead, the team tightened up its shape and went back on the attack, confident that goals would come. As they did: in a fluent move up the right-hand side, right-mid Bhav Virdi delivered his customary cracking cross into the D, where newly subbed-on Dom Nelson finished with an unstoppable first-touch slap. Soon afterwards, Tristen proved his mettle in midfield by dribbling through just about the whole Pboro team, only to see his shot hit the keepers pads. Luckily, Mariano snapped up the rebound to give South the lead. At half-time, the home side were ahead, but conscious that the game was still very much in contest.
Now attacking with the setting sun behind them, South started the second half in good spirits again. A lovely subtle pass by Manu found Dom in the D. His shot being saved, only for Rob to what he does best and poach a goal. At 3-1 South were starting to relax, somewhat prematurely... When a South attack broke down in midfield, a few missed tackles let the Peterborough attack into Shahbazs D, where the attacker took little time to finish off his windfall.
Peterborough were now clearly scenting a come-back into the game and started chasing the equaliser hard. Scant minutes had passed when they seemed to get it: a short corner was won, returned to injector, who rammed it home off Shahbazs pads. Fortunately for South, the umpires ruled the shot on goal to have high, thus disallowing the goal, to Pboro disgust. Souths reprieve was short-lived, though: soon afterwards, a Peterborough surge after filching the ball in midfield found South in some disarray, allowing an unmarked attacker to flick from short range to get on level peggings.
With around 15 minutes left in the game, both sides knew everything was in the balance again. Souths first task, obviously, was to stop Pboros recent momentum, which they did in style. Again, the ball was played up the right-hand side of midfield, where Bhav found himself in the D with half a yard space. Reminiscent of footballing glory (well, for orange-loving Ron Oren, anyway), Bhav deceived everyone (himself included, probably) by playing a cross to close to the line, it actually went in.  Rarely has anyone seen the little dude jump so high in the air with joy!
And still it wasnt over. Peterborough refused to give up and pressured the home side to the last minute. Saving dives by everyone in the defence (most notably Andy Passmore, whos clearly studied Chris Ashtons recent showboating) couldnt prevent one more short going to the visitors - as the final whistle went. To the agony of the midfield, this was repeated twice, as Peterborough managed to find feet of the out-rushing Ian Glover and Bhav. When the solid defence held against the third short as well and the final whistle finally went for real, such a huge cheer erupted one would be excused to think a championship was won. Once again, South showed its grit and determination, fighting hard to keep their campaign to reach dizzying heights on the rails.
Afterwards, skipper Ron may have got somewhat carried away when he said: If we keep playing like this, we dont only deserve to get promoted, but to secure a foothold in the league above too (well, if one allows some paraphrasing to remove post-match overexuberation), but nobody can take away that this was an excellent performance to gain a great result.

Although the first match between these two resulted in a comfortable 4-1 win to South, St Neots is always a tough but to crack at home, so the visitors paid due attention to their preparation. For one player (who shall not be named), that included so dangerous toilet-action that he needed his shin pads on, just in case anything goes wrong. Lemon-awarding complete, the team turned their attention on the game.
As always, South started brightly in the game, taking the ball into St Neots D from every possible angle, but couldnt find the backboard. In fact, it was St Neots that made the first real impact on the game, when a ball was lifted into an onstorming Tim Clapp, hitting him right in the vulnerables; every man, on and off the pitch, cringing in sympathy. Luckily, no real damage was done, as Tim could inform us soon (and with a surprising lack of falsetto). No such luck though with Souths second casualty, Bhav Virdi, who charged down a short corner with his ankle. Latest news on this front is that hes fending off junior doctors at Addenbrookes, bent on amputation; limping off the pitch, he gained himself the epithet of little fallen soldier (although some might say this would be more applicable to Mr Clapp...)
Meanwhile, Tims replacement Manu Bhardwaj was commanding the midfield with strong tackles and calm distribution. It was the same Manu who got a cross (dubiously dangerously, one might add) across the D to attacking back Ian Glover, who dispatched it with poise into the net to give South the lead. Soon after, it was Manu himself that got onto the scoreboard: a short corner was deftly slipped left, where Manu took a touch, a look and flicked it right past the flabbergasted goalie. In the remainder of the half, St Neots started to put some pressure on Souths defence, but found themselves scrambling back when the visitors countered, mostly through Rich Claes fast and mazy running; neither team, however, found the opportunity to change the score.
In the second half, the home team seemed to have changed tactics, defending stolidly and always keeping plenty of men behind the ball. Undaunted, South took up the challenge and kept probing into St Neots half, although sometimes more rashly than they should. Nevertheless, the ball spent plenty of time in the home D and it couldnt be long until this resulted in something tangible. Chilean superstar Mariano Rosenzvaig started his campaign for Player of the Season when he insinuated the ball past a few defenders into the D, survived a swiping challenge at his feet and with consummate style deposited the ball into the top corner.
St Neots kept going forward, making forays into the visitors D and gaining some short corners. But the defence held fast and when anyone got through, goalie Shahbaz Ali was always on hand smother any attempts. Unfortunately, one of those was struck well enough that - although Shahbaz got a hand to it - it disappeared into the top corner after all. At merely 3-1 up, captain Ron Oren exhorted his team to get another score on the board and equal the 1s result for Southerners League. Always obliging, Dom Nelson took it upon himself to slip the ball past the goalie and get South back to bonus points territory. Its an impressive game when only at the 5th goal the ball actually gets to hit the backboard...
In the end, the team realised there were some moments where concentration seemed to waver, but overall the team played quite well. A deserved win keeps the streak - and Souths hope of promotion - alive for yet another week.","Men's 2nds beat St Neots","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

<p>But this did not stop M2 from doing what they do best: &ldquo;ATTACK THE OPPOSITION GOAL!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With 9 men after 2 minutes and Matt Readman (Central mid field) &amp; Mariano (Central defence) making good passes to Tim &amp; Rich Claes on the flanks, M2 managed to get the ball in the opposition D a few times.</p>
<p>But it was Spalding who scored first. They held the ball nicely, rotated it all along the pitch and with a good move from the right flank managed a goal. Although keeper Shahbaz did manage to stop the first shot on goal, the Spalding strikers were heavy on numbers and managed to put the ball into the goal. 1-0 to the visitors!</p>
<p>South never let this goal drop their heads. South were getting enough penalty corners. The first penalty corner was saved by the Spalding goalie. South got a 2nd penalty corner right after; excellent push by Rich, perfect stop by Tim, Mariano does a right slip to Rob, Rob back to Mariano and Mariano scoops the ball easily over the goalie. 1-1!</p>
<p>15 minutes gone. Ah here comes Manu.</p>
<p>With 10 men now on the pitch, South thought &ldquo;why not pump in few more goals&rdquo;. Matt Readman&rsquo;s commanding game in central mid field was an asset and he gave a through pass to Mr.Claes. Rich &ldquo;the-fastest-man-in-east-Anglia&rdquo; Claes started his run and the opposition found a green shirt just go past them. The ball was given to Rob Barton who made no mistake and took his tally to 18 goals this season. 2-1 to South!</p>
<p>Spalding did manage to penetrate the South D, but the great wall of Ron - Andy - Mariano - Tom was skilful enough and rock solid to not give away any goals. It was 2-1 at halftime.</p>
<p>South were playing with 10 men for 50 minutes now and Spalding stepped up the gas and after 10 minutes got a penalty corner. They scored the goal but the strike on goal was a little high and was very intelligently deflected in the goal by the Spalding striker. Cambridge South protested about the height but was given a goal by the umpires. 2-2!</p>
<p>Spalding got their third goal with 10 minutes to go. The Spalding right winger carried the ball from his half into the South 25. With every South player marking the Spalding players this allowed the Spalding right winger to go in the south D and take a shot at goal. It wasn&rsquo;t a clear hit and the ball bounced off the turf. South players thought it would be given dangerous by the umpires but it wasn&rsquo;t and the Spalding striker took the final touch into the South goal.</p>

<p>With 7 minutes left, surprise-surprise Dave Monck arrived. Ron&rsquo;s message to Dave was clear &ldquo;Run your arse off!&rdquo; and so he did. With 11 players on the pitch now, the ball never reached the South 25 in the next 7 minutes.</p>
<p>South made another penetration into the Spalding D with Tim, Manu, Rich, Rob and Mariano on the attack. Andy &ldquo;Central Defender&rdquo; took the ball from the South half into the Spalding D and gave a cracking hit; this was saved by the Spalding keeper. Rob &ldquo;Goal hungry lion&rdquo; pounced on the rebound; his hit was also stopped by the keeper. But then &ldquo;The Mighty Chilean&rdquo; Mariano, put the ball into the goal. 3-3 and 5 minutes to go! The question was rightly asked &ldquo;What were the central defender (Andy) and the sweeper (Mariano) doing in the opposition D?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back on the attack straight! Tim, Rich and Rob were in the Spalding D in no time and South got their 4th goal. Rich made a brilliant run from the South half into the Spalding D; he passed the ball to Rob who made no mistake to put it into the goal (Rob&rsquo;s scored 19 goals this season for the M2s, never mind the goals he scored for M1, M3 &amp; M4). South were leading again at 4-3. With 30 seconds left it was easy to defend the small lead.</p>

The first few moments of the match perhaps justified the umpires decision as lots of South passes went to players in green. South consequently found themselves under unexpected amounts of self-inflicted pressure from a team fighting against relegation. When South did string some passes together they had to be wary of an Ely side which, like their 2nds, were eager to counter attack at high speed and pressure the opposition defense at all times.
A combination of a defensive slip under pressure and this speed gave Ely the first break through as a rapid attack couldnt be contained and Ely slotted home to take a 1-0 lead. If there had been any complacency in the South team it was well and truly blown away by this.
Stung by the goal South began to up their game, passes began to go to sticks and Messrs Clapp, Claes and Stafford began to show that charging breaks from midfield were not an Ely monopoly. Ely still looked dangerous on the break though and Shahbaz had to advance rapidly to stifle some dangerous moments, but South were getting more pressure. 
This pressure told when Tim was found on the penalty spot from a pull back from the left and swept into the goal to level the scores. With the scores even the play remained even with South not quite at their best but challenging the Ely rearguard and Ely threatening with their speed at the other end. The crucial next goal was Souths though as in the mirror image of the first goal a Rob Barton pull back found Tim again, who swept into the goal again.
Half time came with South 2-1 up but making it hard for themselves, with a pep talk emphasising simple hockey and going for the 50-50s. The next goal was going to be crucial.
South started the half with more control and composure than they had in the first and making dangerous use of the wings. It was just reward when Rob Barton popped up to extend the teams lead and his lead in the Goal Kings competition with a clinical finish. A two goal margin gave South a slightly more comfortable cushion which rapidly got more comfortable as Alex whod been roaming dangerously on the right wing buried a trademark reverse stick hit to make it 4-1. 
While Shahbaz and the defense still had a couple of rapid breaks to stifle the last fifteen minutes now found South in their comfort zone and able to play their rapid passing hockey, helped a little as the Ely side tired so didnt pressure the defense as much but still tried to press forward with the ball leaving space behind them.
Rich was the first to take advantage as a quickly taken free hit found him at the top left of the D allowing him to drive in and slot under the keeper to make it 5-1. Rob made it six when he met Alexs cross at the near post to deflect in, and then avoided having to buy a jug by getting one on one with the Ely keeper, but having beaten him could only bounce the ball off the post with pinpoint accuracy.

More importantly, the game was an opportunity to get good, honest revenge on Boston for inflicting an uncalled-for defeat in the first meeting. Little surprise then, that the team was raring to go and gave skipper Ron Oren a multitude of players to choose from.
Boston, on the other hand, were less bothered - or possibly struggling with traffic - showing up with a mere 4 players at the arranged time for push-back. Eventually, the visitors having found enough for 7 outfielders and a goalie, the game started rather lopsidedly. Which, to common chagrin, only threw Souths composure and organisation, leaving them struggling to make use of the 3 free men they had. In fact, its fair to say that Boston had the better part of play, considering their numerical inferiority. Thus, when Bostons reinforcements arrived, they were hailed with sighs of relief on both sides (albeit silent ones for the home team).
Still, it took South time to settle down to the business of playing hockey. It was only quick thinking Tim Clapp that gave them the lead: a long corner taken before the defence was set allowed him to drive into the D and pass the ball to fellow-striker Rob Barton, only for the latter to find the goalie. Beating everyone else to the rebound, Matt Readman didnt take any chance and flicked the ball high into the side netting.
If South thought they were now in for a cruising, they were quickly set straight. Bostons quick forwards made every break out of their defence dangerous and tested keeper Shahbazs pads regularly. In one of their attacks, Bostons striker bypassed sweeper Dave Monck with an ingenious one-two with his own feet. His subsequent pass to the far post was watched by everyone, strikers and defenders, only to trickle over the line unchallenged. Luckily it may have been, but the goal was not against the run of play.
As in previous games, an opposition goal only served to wake up South and moments of good hockey finally started to show. A lovely pass from Matt found the ever energetic Manu Bhardwaj in the right corner; loath to take on his man, Manu simply crossed the ball into the D, where Rob dispatched it coolly to give South the lead again. Mere minutes later, it was Rob again that got his name on the score-board, this time slipping the ball under a charging goalie at close range. With a 2-goal cushion, nerves were finally settling in the home side and they started to press the visitors more. In the dying minutes of the first half, the game was finally put out of Bostons reach: a hard cross driven in from the right was deflected beautifully through the keepers legs to trickle over the line. The scorer? A rather unfortunate defender... although official credit should go to Bhav Virdi for the cross.
After half-time, South were searching for the form that would let them put further goals past Boston and improve their chances of getting promoted. Boston, however, made good use of the break to finally get their team properly sorted and frustrated Souths efforts at every turn. The home side wasnt helped either by the epic failure of various South players to provide even half-decent injections at the short corners, neutralising one of their own weapons of attack. As a result, although plenty of chances materialised at either side of the pitch, neither team could convert even a single one of those and the score remained at 4-1 until full-time.
It wasnt the most polished of performances for South and - to be fair to Boston - the score line is a bit flattering for the home side. But the team did exactly what they had to do: they won the game, secured the club record and kept promotion dependent on Pboros result. With the latter obliging and slipping up against relegation-threatened Market Deeping, Souths season was crowned with a promotion to Div 3NW, the highest the team as ever been. With 11 consecutive wins in the season (beating every other team in the second half of the season), nobody can deny they deserved it with their grit and determination.","Men's 2nds win PROMOTION with a victory over Boston","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

A promising start by the South midfield was rudely suffocated when a solo run by one of the home midfielders was left unchecked as he skipped into the circle and unleashed a fierce lifter which Steve Parker, diving to his right, could only deflect on its way in.  The South keeper had better fortune with his next piece of action, a firm block to a low, flicked short corner, the remains of which were cleared away by Rob Garrett.  The skipper, setting a fine example with his positive forward movement and energetic tackling back, had much to do as Wisbech concentrated on possession hockey but South created their chances as well, Graham McCulloch firing just wide from a slipped short corner won after aggressive work from Russell Johnson.  A second South short ensued following Sanjay Agarwala's skilful use of sensible distribution from Dave Aston and Mark Williams, but a rightward slip from James Hawkes was unmet.  The latter then forced a save from the Wisbech keeper with a flicked effort before a profitable line of inquiry again involving Garrett, Aston and Williams saw Agarwala, unaccustomedly popping up on the right this time, asking serious questions of the home defence.  Garrett had the keeper on his knees smothering the ball at another short but Wisbech escaped to bang the ball into South's circle, where George Wych reversed out with aplomb and Ian Glover finally made safe.  Evenly poised at this stage, and looking promising as a raking midfield move involving the improving James Cobbe and others made good ground towards the top corner, the game took a turn for the worse when a mishit cross from Wisbech skewered off a defensive South stick, opening up plenty of space for a grateful poacher to double the advantage.
Wisbech cranked up the pressure, testing Parker with a firm shot which he cleared beyond the D, but South were still trying to spread the ball as Garrett worked like a Trojan in both attack and defence, once making a crunching low tackle and then circumnavigating four men to guide the ball to safety.  Slightly closer support was perhaps needed but, after an angled Wisbech cross had just failed to find a winger ghosting behind the defence on the far post, concerted good work from Garrett and Jack Chalk, pressing upwards after a couple of nifty pirouettes midfield, drew a save from the home keeper and then a fourth short corner.  From this, a crisp double slip made its way through to Agarwala, who was in perfect position to reduce the deficit and give South the lift they wanted a psychologically opportune two minutes before half-time.
Wisbech jumped straight back into the fray after the restart, a well-positioned Parker blocking a reverse that was unfussily cleared by Glover, but South then completed their double whammy when McCulloch injected a swift short corner and then headed for the spot to redirect Hawkes's firm slap into the upper half of the goal.  The umpires eventually rejected Wisbech's protestations, so 2-2 it was and the home side redoubled both their efforts and, presently, their decibel levels.  Parker's good balance made sure a close-range shot loosed after a goal-line run was thwarted and then cleared to the wing before Williams fed Johnson, who penetrated the circle but was brought up short by the rather larger Wisbech keeper.  A bout of hacking in the D led to South's sixth short, from which Chalk's shot was blocked, whereupon Johnson's long pass narrowly evaded Hawkes racing forward.
Wisbech's tactical discussions seemed to bear fruit as they started to edge possession and, though McCulloch contended with typical sinew up the right and Parker dispatched out to the corner, Wisbech created a sudden breakaway.  Parker dived desperately and, though missing his man, diverted him enough to allow Aston to swiftly shadow attacker and ball to squeaky safety just past the post.  Then, after Johnson had blocked an advance stemming from a left-wing cross, the ball ran dangerously free from the ensuing 16 and Parker had to race out and slam down the long barrier to prevent a further incursion.  Two penalty corners for Wisbech followed in short order but again South were equal to the task.  From the first, a double slip opened up a big gap but Parker made a fine low stick save, only to see the second phase scoop the ball up and over towards goal where, thankfully, Aston was perfectly placed to bring off a great save on the line with commendable sang froid.  The second drew a solid block from the South keeper and an assured clearance from Glover but this barely interrupted Wisbech's spell of control inside South's 25.  Garrett played his full part in a defence that stayed for the most part pretty calm and unflustered and South managed to break the shackles with a few robust thrusts up the right, although they were hard pressed to keep the ball in the Wisbech half when they got there.  Nevertheless, they successfully withstood Wisbech's persistent hassling and, after a final near-post intervention by Parker five minutes from time, they looked unlikely to concede.
This was an entertaining and hard-fought game in which South's new-look defence, revolving around a composed Wych, did well to hold their committed and direct opponents at bay.  There was much common-sense application at the back and, when South were allowed to move the ball around further up the field, a hint that they could cause problems, even against a solid defence like Wisbech's.  A short-corner tally of six to three in South's favour bears this out, and a conversion rate of two from six shows some promise.  Next up are Horncastle, who have endured something of a baptism of fire after their promotion but who have probably been unlucky to start off against two teams likely to be among the hotter promotion contenders.","Men's 1sts come back from 2-0 down to draw with Wisbech","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Maybe it was down to Colin's meticulous mid-week training on EncouragementWithinTheTeam. Maybe it was the relief that this was a home fixture against Horncastle and so a 6am departure for the Scottish Borders was not required. Maybe it was the rousing pre-match team-talk from Captain Garrett which left more than a few players misty-eyed with tears of (manly) passion. Or maybe it was the fact that the opposition had conceded 27 goals in their first two league games... 
No - I'm pretty sure it was the team-talk.
With the arrival of Readman at the pitch signaling the start of the match, Cambridge started brightly, eager to pile the pressure on the more chronologically gifted opposition. And so they did, with Hawkes making clever use of his shins to control a panicked flick from the Honcastle defence, driving into the D and slotting the ball calmly past the diving keeper and into the corner of the goal.  1-0. 
Horncastle to their credit did mount a few quick attacks, forcing some assured clearances from Parker in goal. But for the most part, the defensive skills of Readman, Aston, Wych and Bristowe (returning to the side after a week of 'work' in Spain) were too much for them and the frequency and coordination of these attacks dropped as the game went on. And as soon as an attack was broken down, Russel 'now you see me...now I'm past you' Johnson would be breaking fast on a counter-attack.
Making full use of their pitch-coloured camouflage shirts, Cambridge sneaked up with another attack and, with the benefit of some imaginative umpiring, won their first (and only) short corner. Opinions on how the resulting goal was allowed were equally imaginative. Some say the ball was propelled with such back-spin that it did actually cross the goal-line below backboard height before swerving dramatically upwards to hit the middle of the net. Others argued that the reverse stick shot from McCulloch was in fact a superbly executed (not to mention powerful) reverse stick drag-flick. Bristowe, the short-corner stiker, maintains that the stop, turn and shot of McCulloch was merely an elaborate deflection of Bristowe's original 'shot'.  2-0.
Shortly after, more chaotic defending by the disgruntled Horncastle defenders was seized on by McCulloch, volleying a bouncing ball into the net with the keeper floundering on the floor. 3-0. With the bit firmly between their teeth, Cambridge poured forwards again. Aston releasing Hawkes up the line to start off a move which the papers are allegedly now citing as an early contender for Goal Of The Season. Swift and decisive passing between Hawkes, Ta and Williams cut through the Horncastle defence, with Williams clinically dispatching the ball past the onrushing keeper to complete the move. 4-0. 
At this stage, with the result seemingly in the bag, players minds turned to more important matters. Specifically, how to increase their team's Fantasy Hockey score. The Game within the Game, so to speak. Perhaps this accounts for the games most surprising statistic: a shot on goal from Aston, clearly thinking of the extra points for a defender scoring.  Rising above all this introspective fantasy though was Simon Ta, who doesn't feature in his own Fantasy Team and yet graciously scored a fine individual goal (on his birthday no less), dribbling the ball into the D on the left, past three defenders before shooting through the narrowest gap between keeper and post. 5-0.
With Garrett back in his established role dominating the middle of the pitch and Cobbe and Williams taking every opportunity to embarrass the weary Horncastle midfield, the final 10 minutes were a chance to enjoy our hockey. Readman, presumably bored with a quiet day at the office at right back, charged up the pitch to join in the fun, sending the opposing defenders fleeing for cover as he flicked in Cambridge's sixth over the grounded keeper. 6-0 and time for a celebration. 
Much credit must go to Horncastle who played with spirit, persistence and a sense of humour despite being on the wrong end of some of the more curious umpiring decisions and obviously having lost a lot of players since their 100% winning record last season.  
Man of the Match went to McCulloch 'for having great legs'. Asked for a comment later, McCulloch stated he was ""mildly flattered and hugely disturbed"" by the unexpected attention to his legs. Lemon of the Match went to Garrett, in part for selecting a curry house for the team social that many claim was actually closer to Horncastle than Cambridge.

Not about the result of the match however, as that was never really in doubt once the Home team only turned up with 10 men, but about the Lemon of the Match award which was closely balanced all the way through the game.
Nick Bristowe made an early play for the title with a shocking performance in the toilets before the game which rendered them unfit for use but his efforts were put to shame on the pitch by John Hawkes who did his best to help Rutland out by seemingly playing as an extra man in their defence and making a number of fantastic clearances when it would have been easier to have put the ball in the goal. Not content with this profligacy in front of goal, Hawkes also got a yellow card for not retreating 5 metres at a free hit, only 30 seconds after the team had been warned of this infringement by the umpire. So, at half time, Hawkes sat down confident that the coveted Lemon would be his but he had not counted for Dave Aston stepping in at the last moment to take the award, more of which later. 
In amongst this move and countermove there was also some excellent hockey play. With a one man advantage there was always going to be room to move the ball about and South kept Rutland on the back foot throughout most of the match. Strong play from Rob Garrett and Al Sinclair in midfield, together with the usual pace and skill up the right from Eliot Read and Russell Johnson led to a number of chances early in the first half. However most of these fell to Hawkes who (see above) had his eye on the main prize so it was not until the 20 minute mark that South got the breakthrough when Garrett drove into the D and played the ball past the keeper to Hawkes who saw his clearance saved on the line by a defensive foot. Jack Chalk stepped up to take the resulting penalty stroke and dispatched it confidently past the keepers outstretched left hand.
A few minutes later South doubled their lead when Garrett picked up a superb pass from James Cobbe and played the ball in to Chalk who took a snap shot and then buried the resulting rebound into the roof of the net for his second goal of the game. 
Rutland, despite being a man short, did not let their heads drop and kept playing a high tempo game. Most of their efforts were snuffed out with strong tacking in midfield - in particular Sinclair and Garrett proving to be impassable - but towards halftime the home team won a short corner and pressed for a goal to keep the game alive. The first effort was charged down by George Wych but the next one was well worked and gave a gilt-edged chance to the young Rutland forward who, with the South defence stranded, contrived to miss an open goal from 3 feet out.
This provided a timely reminder to South that the game was not yet won and after half time there was more urgency in the play. Moving up the left Cobbe and Aston linked together and the resulting ball into the D won another short corner. A direct shot on goal then rebounded kindly to Sinclair who calmly lifted it past the despairing defence. Not long after this the game was put to bed by Johnson who, receiving the ball just in front of the keeper, lifted it over his pads to make it 4-0.
With the match won there was still time for the final act in the Lemon competition. Some say he is just being competitive, others cower in fear at his outbursts. In the last few minutes Dave Aston, whose temper is never far below boiling point saw a red mist come over him and launched a potty mouthed outburst  at a fellow teammate who failed to pass the ball to him, thus earning Souths second yellow card of the game. Whilst Aston took the walk of shame to the side of the pitch, Hawkes was seen celebrating an unlikely escape from the Lemon!
Despite the two yellows (and another one for Rutland) the game was played in a very good spirit. South played well but credit also goes to the home side for keeping it competitive despite only have 10 players. South now have 10 points from a possible 12 and hope to continue this good start with the match next week against March.","Men's 1sts beat 10 man Rutland","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

The weather was kind enough to stay dry for the duration, but the recent rains meant the playing pitch was slippier than usual and both Eliot and Russ had 'moments', which resulted in slightly red faces and legs akimbo.

In a cagey opening to the game, both sides put together some good passing moves but no clear cut opportunities came either way until Cambridge South started to exert some more concerted pressure on the visitor's goal.  Some excellent running and link-up play between the front 3 of Graham, Simon and Russell was causing the March rear-guard problems, and the support from variously Jack, Mark and Al in midfield kept Cambridge South on the front foot.  The fleet-footed March attackers always posed a threat, though, and George and Nick had to be alert to see off various counter-attacks.

It was only ever going to be a matter of time before a goal came, and it fell to the away team when a ball into the D from a March midfielder found it's way to their striker in front of goal, and with only Parker to beat he slotted coolly into the corner.  A set-back, to be sure, but the home side re-doubled their efforts and pushed forward once more.  Their reward arrived about 8 minutes later when another cracking pass from Nick at the back set Simon ""what are those ridiculous tights?"" Ta on his way and his square ball found the marauding Garrett in the D, who casually evaded the keeper and stuck the ball in the goal.

The final 10 minutes of the half were a tight affair with both teams sensing a breakthrough was imminent and South had to work hard to keep March out as a number of crosses flew past the serene Parker in goal.
Cambridge built up some momentum, though, and were rewarded with a goal on the stroke of half-time when an apparent lost-cause was chased down by Simon and fed back to Graham, who squared the ball to Jack in front of the March goal.  A shimmy, a side-step and then a nonchalant finish and his 3rd goal in 2 games was 'chalked' up.  Sorry.

With the game finely balanced at half-time both sides knew the next goal would be crucial and March started fully intent on making sure they got it.  As they pushed forward the home side was forced to defend deep and in numbers but the hard work restricted March to very few real opportunities.  When they did manage to fashion a glimpse of goal, Parker was more than equal to it and a smart save to his right kept the visitors searching for the equaliser.

As the half wore on Cambridge managed to assert themselves more, and the March threat waned.  Chances were created, but the killer 3rd goal remained elusive.  In the end the home side was able to see out the game in relative comfort, until the final moments when a March were awarded a short corner on the stroke of full-time.  Fortunately for Cambridge, it came to nought.

Let's hope that this momentum can be maintained into their next league game against close rivals Cambridge Nomads.","Men's 1sts beat March","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Despite the returning centre back George Wych helping to add some much needed discipline to the defence, it was St Neots who started the brighter, spraying passes around the back from left to right, and winning an early short.   However, the returning Wych was out like a flash, and snuffed out the danger.
As the half wore on, South grew in stature (and number too- Chalk arrived to replace the injured Bhardwaj), and started to string together a number of good attacks.   The team were also winning a number of short corners through some last ditch defending from Neots in the area.   After an initial effort from Bristowe was charged down, a small bout of hockey pinball ensued.   However, McCulloch was well placed to reverse slap the ball home into the net to put South one up.
This gave South the confidence boost they needed, and they started to string together the hockey we all know they are capable of.   Mark Williams and Rob Garrett were running the show in the midfield- Garretts reverse stick tackling being particularly worthy of mention.   Down the flanks, McCulloch and Johnson were ably supported by Chalk and Wych and Souths pace was clearly causing Neots some problems.   Simon Ta up front was always causing problems with his pace and harrying.   Further short corners followed before half time, which were expertly diverted away by the opposition defence.   
However, South were not to be denied the second goal before the break that their play merited.   After an initial shot from Bristowe was saved on the line (when will that man score?), Johnson was first to react, and lifted the ball over the line at the second attempt.
At half time, captain Garrett was keen to stress that while the first half had gone well, the game wasnt over, and South would have to work hard to maintain their advantage.
The second half began in much the same vein as the first had ended; hard work from the attack and midfield leaving the defence with little to do.   Manu returned to the field of play and had a fine display at right back, showing great composure on the ball and starting a wave of attacks.   Wych was sharp as ever in the middle, and Bristowe mopped up anything that came through.   Parker was alert for any shots that had to be clawed away - a fine palm off his far post being a good demonstration of this.
As the half wore on Neots began to pour more and more forward (and more or more into the umpires with various expletives and descent), but despite two or three short corners, no further shots ensued.   Whilst South were slightly wasteful on the breakaway, with a number of promising openings going to waste, they never really looked like letting Neots back into the game, and they professionally closed out victory.
Next week sees South make the trip to pace setters Rutland, which will surely be their toughest test yet.   However, no teams should be feared by South, and if they play to their best, they will definitely cause the leaders problems.","Men's 1sts beat St Neots","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

South fielded a strong team, albeit lacking erstwhile skipper Rob Garrett who has callously dumped his team and gone to America but including a return from superstar Al Sinclair. 
The match was evenly contested, with South matching Rutlands pace and skill throughout and probably creating more chances overall but just lacking in that final pass / shot to score an open play goal. 
Rutland scored first when, after a passage of dominance, one of their forwards found half a yard of space to turn and shoot from the penalty spot and the Away team went into the second half 1-0 up. South rallied at half time and came back with a goal of their own for a superb short corner routine played back to the injector (new skipper Graham McCulloch) who deftly applied the finish. However, hopes of a recovery and victory were dashed when Rutland scored from a short corner themselves, the ball was slipped left and then a powerful strike (which looked suspiciously high when it crossed the line) put South 2-1 down.
South redoubled their efforts in the last 10 minutes but could not force an equaliser. Result elsewhere mean that promotion hopes are still high as we remain 2nd in the Division but on the day the better team won.","Men's 1sts lose to Rutland","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

After a detailed team talk from skipper McCulloch (complete with undersized strategy board) South took to the pitch for the warmup.   One particular unnamed South player decided at this point that the sandy pitch needed slickening up, and proceeded to, in his own way, give it a good watering......
South began the game the brighter, with some fizzing passes in the final third, with the duo of Phil and Tom contributing well to the team's new attacking flair.   One such move found McCulloch in space in the D and he tucked the goal away to the keeper's left with aplomb.
After this promising start, South were determined not to let their focus slip, and after some excellent further play by Watson, they found themselves two up.   Chasing a lost cause, Watson won the ball back off the opposition in their D, and, with everyone expecting the shot, played a delightful strong reverse stick pass (off the post) into the path of McCulloch, who gratefully finished from all of half a yard.
Further attacks came and went without reward, until some frantic fenland fouling led to a short corner.  South's slick routine of the pass back to the taker led to a third for McCulloch. The irony of his pre-match words saying ""lets play as a team"" have not gone unnoticed!
At half time, the key message from the skipper was to keep the discipline up after a few concentration lapses almost let in March towards the end of the first period.
South began the second half in confident mood, and soon stretched their lead- that man McCulloch selfishly stealing the glory to make it four after another fine run and cutback from the game's star player Watson.
Despite a yellow card for Phil Crowhurst on his debut (for an early Valentines loving hand on the back of the opposition) South held out comfortably for the win- the gloss of which was put on by Chalk by a sublime aerial which surely put him into contention for MoM*...... and then taken away by the same player, with some more than regular ventures into areas which most right backs would call ""the unknown"", despite repeated calls from Eliot to ""keep his discipline!""   
Despite this however, South can be rightly proud of what was, in the end, a very comprehensive and professional victory, which should restore the confidence after last week's reverse.

Its fair to say that Cambridge South were more than pumped up for this game, eager to repeat their performance against Nomads earlier in the season which ended with a hard-fought 2-0 victory to South. 
The enormity of the occasion had clearly not gone un-noticed with the local sports-fans as a sizeable crowd (there must have been at least 10) braved the drizzle to watch the spectacle. Much appreciated - sorry we couldn't have given you a win!
As the game got under-way, it quickly became apparent that Nomads hadn't been lazing around since that previous match. In fact, its entirely possible they might have even been practising! Or recruiting. Either way, South were slightly caught off-guard by the swift distribution, assured touches and accurate passing from the opposition. Nevertheless South held on and the meanest defence in the league lived up to its name, with Read, Wych and Aston notching up tackle after tackle and Bristow recycling the ball to relieve the pressure. Watson, Williams and Graveling worked hard in midfield to give the forwards something to work with but a combination of disciplined marking from Nomads, a few miss-cued passes and a very slippery pitch conspired to leave the forwards with slim pickings - the only notable chance being a close-range reverse stick effort from McCulloch which was deflected wide off the keeper's pads. 
The team re-grouped at half-time and played with more composure in the second half. Ironically this was when Nomads scored. Firstly a drag-flick finally broke Steve's 'brick-wall goalkeeping' after another short-corner was awarded for a rash challenge by the under-pressure defence, and then, following a generous pass to the opposition striker from Bristow that had the bookies calling their lawyers, a miss-hit shot bounced agonisingly over the stranded keeper to leave South with a mountain to climb.
South responded with guts and more creative play. As usual, Aston typified this creativity - cleverly attempting to make use of the large expanses of space that were being left un-marked by Nomads. This might have worked, if the umpires had not cruely intervened and pointed out that, strictly speaking, hockey was supposed to be played within the boundary lines of the pitch and therefore passing the ball directly out of bounds from a side-line hit could not be allowed. 
There was still time for Johnson to ping a shot just wide with Watson inches short of a deflection at the far post and for a quickly taken free-hit by McCulloch to flash past Johnson's stick with the goal at his mercy. In the end we ran out of time. 
Credit to the team for giving 110% throughout the match and the supporters for cheering us on all the way. The aim for the rest of the season remains the same - win every match! ","Men's 1sts lose to Nomads","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

The prospect of thumping Cambridge City was keenly anticipated as South had dominated the reverse fixture and recent results suggested City hadn't exactly improved. And sure enough, South dominated again right from the off, with Eliot, Nick and Dave nonchalantly smashing the ball around the back, generating attack after attack as City were forced to chase the ball. 
Two early goals from the 'Terrier Attack' (Jack and Russell), courtesy of some slick moves from midfield and some less-slick football skills from the City defence put South in the driving seat, so to speak, and the game settled down with Mark, Jack and Jon combining in midfield and Simon, Russell and dbutante Rich running rings around the defence to make sure South had the lion's share of the possession.  It would be no exaggeration to say that if that last pass had been accurate or we'd put our short-corners away or if the pitch hadn't been so slippery with mud that some passages of play in the D resembled an ice-hockey match, then we might have gone in at half time eight or nine goals up. 
As it was, we just made it 3-0 at half-time, as Jon finally unleashed his trademark 'only-in-training' blistering shot on a Saturday, the ball satisfyingly pinging off the inside of the post and back across the goal to nestle just inside the other post.
The start of the second half saw City playing with a bit more urgency as they made several useful attacks. Each one was unapologetically stopped in its tracks by either the scything reverse stick of George or a graceful shimmy and turn from Nick who had obviously decided that if he included enough step-overs, pirouettes and triple-lutzes, the opposition marker would eventually just fall to the ground from sheer dizziness. A sample video of Nick in his ballerina prime is on its way to the producers of Dancing on Ice as I write... 
City meanwhile were rapidly losing the plot, with incessant arguing, complaining and abuse to anyone who would listen (I know - who would have thought...). So it was astonishing that this period of play resulted in their only goal, from a moment of relaxation in the South defence. But South responded well and kept surging forward with more attacks. Even Dave was spotted in the opposition's D on several occasions (and sharply reprimanded...). But as much as it pains me to say it, it was Jon's 'commanding' play from midfield that was the highlight; another scorcher of a shot hit from the edge of the D nearly bursting the top of the side-netting as it went agonizingly wide, and then a tidy dribble past some 'robust' tackles from City to put the ball on the proverbial plate for Russell to prod in his second of the match. 
There was still time for South to miss a bucket-load more chances, and to watch as an opposition player that your HR dept. would describe as 'more experienced' threw his stick down and stormed off following a row with another team-mate. I'm pleased to report that all South players stuck to their game and played in a professional manner throughout. Pats on the back all round, eh. Its always difficult to play at your best when the opposition don't provide much of a challenge, but South will need to significantly raise their game in their remaining fixtures.
Still, some important lessons were learnt. In particular 'Always be prepared' - you never know when those old football boots might be useful in a hockey game, and (as a certain Mr Williams found to his cost) always carry a spare tyre in your car.","Men's 1st beat Cambridge City","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

James Mark and Jack controlled the midfield, and in front of them the forward three were making intelligent runs in front of them to cause the Wisbech defence problems. A quickly taken sideline ball lead to Tom Watson feeding James Cobbe inside the D, and, with the time and space to pick his spot, James calmly drove the ball into the bottom corner. One nil.</p>
<p>However, instead of settling into their passing game as they had done last week, South began to give Wisbech a foothold in the match. A quick ball into the D was deflected towards the goal by the Wisbech forward, and was only denied by an expert save from Steve Parker. &ldquo;Wis&rdquo; were also looking dangerous on short corners, with two excellent saves from Steve preventing the opposition actually going into the break in the lead, never mind level.</p>
<p>At half time, captain Dave stressed the need to press home South&rsquo;s advantage and that the Wisbech chances should serve as a wakeup call.

<p>Slowly but surely though, South began to find their feet. Quick incisive passing from Mark Rob and John led to a South short corner.

More overdue than the new Cambridge South shirts I&rsquo;d say, but nevertheless a very well taken goal, which settled South&rsquo;s nerves (or most people&rsquo;s aside from the lunatic that is Dave Aston- who bellowed at the top of his voice that South in no way deserved the goal, much to the amusement of the opposition and dismay of most of his teammates).

<p>After this goal, South began to look again like a side who belonged at the top of the league. With Cobbe Watson Ta and Chalk tearing down the flanks, and Garrett Williams and Hawkes easily having the beating of their men the home team looked certain to add to their lead. In fact, before John Hawkes expertly lifted in a third following a goalmouth melee, the Wis keeper made what was a contender for save of the season. A dynamic, mesmerising Dave Aston run (or a complete lack of interest from the Wisbech defence depending on which way you look at it) was thwarted by an outstretched toe (or the middle of a foot planted ten seconds earlier) of the keeper, to keep the lead down to two.</p>

Shahbaz Ali, his usual commanding self, prevented numerous shots, but couldnt get near the one that gained Spalding a deserved lead.

Saturday Morning arrived and stand-in Captain John Benedikz was still juggling players to make sure he had an 11 to take to March. Oddly 16:00 away in deepest darkest Fenland did not prove to be the exciting draw for players I expected it would be. Missing 11 regular 3s players, South travelled to March with only 6 regulars, with the remainder being made up of 4s who had the week off and 2s. All of whom I thank for putting themselves forward.

The game started, as expected, amidst the fenland drizzle, with March (freshly relegated from 4NW), pushing forward and forcing South onto the defensive. Marchs first goal was not long in coming when a harmless looking cross clipped off the foot of a defender and rolled into the goal. South then slipped further behind when a March foot was not spotted and the ball was driven into the top of the net.

The new look South midfield of Kern, Jelly, Glover and Deacon were forced to spend most of their time defending, however on several occasions in each half, South took the game to March and with Rob Barton and James Raikes up front, South reminded March they were going to have to fight hard for their result.

Just before half-time, South had their own stroke of luck, when a forward pass from Matt Kern was left by the keeper at the top of the D to run out for a 16, only for Rob Barton, to nip round him and role the ball into an empty net, 2v1 and South were back in with a chance.

Half Time March 2v1 South
The second half unfortunately started as the first had, with March finishing off a well worked move to edge 3v1 ahead. South began to push forward again and got back into the game with an excellently placed Rob Barton special from the top of D, 3v2. South and South continued to search of an equaliser which they were cruelly denied when a diving Ian Glover turned the ball into the net, only for it to be ruled out (correctly) for a back stick.
This spurred South on and as they pushed forward with the game ticking on, gaps began to appear as legs tired and March hit South twice in the last 10 minutes to add gloss to a scoreline for them in a game that turned on a couple of decisions. That said March were clearly the stronger team and deserved their victory. The south defence of Sneade, Sharp, Evans and Benedikz and in particular Man of the Match Shabhaz Ali were under near constant pressure (I lost count of the number of shorts after 13), but South were always in with a sniff of a result until the very latter stages of the game.","Men's 3rds lose to March","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

This was followed up by Dom Nelson tweaking his hamstring mid way through the second half.
Sporting a new 3232 formation South took some a while to adjust to the new formation, with Alford taking full advantage, with their star striker stretching the South defense and slotting in a first half hat-trick. Momment of the first half for South was a slick counter attacking move involving Paul South slotting the ball through to Stuart Creed, who dribbled into the Alford D and slotted a long distance shot into corner past the despairing Alford keeper.
Half time: 4v1
After a stirring half-time team talk from Vicky Lavis South came out looking to get back into the game and for a while looked like they may get an unlikely point. Alford moved 5v1 up before man of the match Chris Rigge slotted in 2 quick goals to pull the score back to 5v3. South then had an excellent chance to reduce the deficit further, but the ball snuck just the wrong side of the post. As the game progressed and injuries mounted, South legs tired and Alford claimed a couple of quick goals at the death.

The first half was goalless, although John Greaves was unlucky as a goal-bound scorcher was deflected by a Deeping defender's leg just wide of the post. Both teams had their moments, with Deeping more composed, but CSouth the more forceful. Greaves got his reward with the opening goal shortly after the interval, as his long range and sweetly timed effort found the net after a pinpoint pass from Stu Creed into the D.
Deeping retaliated all too soon with a fine flick into the top corner from a short corner. The game could well have finished at 1 -1 which would have been a fair result, but....
A hotly disputed second home goal was given by the distant umpire after his colleague close to the action had ruled a rising shot - deflected off a defenders stick - too high straight from the short corner. The misery was compounded as Deeping snuck in a third when a free hit, taken quickly some distance from the offence which caused it, wrong-footing the away defence, ended up in a short corner, from which they scored with the final move of the match.
The scoreline obscured the excellent defending, particularly from MoM Benedikz & Kern. Their colleagues in defence, Dom Nelson and James Lee, both took nasty knocks on their extremities but manfully played on. 
Ultimately CSouth were unable to overcome these misfortunes and the canny ""go for the obstruction / foot / appeal"" approach of the Deeping players. This leaves us mired in the relegation tussle in a league where most teams are much of a muchness.

The first half was quite even with the only goal coming from a CSouth short corner routine that actually worked; Greaves to P.South and back to Greaves lurking by the near post to force the ball through the defenders on the line. This gave the away side the confidence to make some fine attacking moves, with Jonny Deacon, Richard Marley and Dom Nelson orchestrating things  from central midfield and wings Wilco Dijkstra  and Rupert Espley providing width and options.
The match hinged around a 10 minute period in the second half, during which CSouth bagged a further 3 goals. Rupert Espley dribbled in from the corner and spotted the opportunity to shoot from a tight angle. The ball ricochetted off a couple of defenders before finding the net, escorted by sniffer Greaves, who helped it on its way to the back board. This was swiftly followed by Greaves grabbing his second goal with a neat deflection wrongfooting the keeper from the penalty spot off a Deacon shot, and then a terrific back stick thumper from Wilco Dijkstra, who controlled and shot calmly from range. 
Mariano Rosenwaiz topped his excellent overall display with a forceful dribble and unstoppable shot from 2 feet out to get CSouth's fifth and final goal. This didn't stop us looking for more and Paul South, and John Greaves were both unlucky not to add to the tally.

Nomads didn't play badly, and probably had the 3 most skilful players om the pitch, but the great team work, energy and confidence of CSouth didn't give them much hope.

South 2nds went into the game missing some key players and with a squad that included six defenders and only four recognised midfielders. Captain Kev Rowland therefore had to mix up the tactics and play a number of people out of position, so it was hardly surprising that the team started slowly.
The opposition were out of the blocks quickly and in the first ten minutes most of the play was in the 2nds half. However with MoM Leo Tomita marshalling a defence of Ron Oren, George Wych and Nick Bristowe, the opposition were closed down quickly and unable to take advantage of this early territory.
As the half progressed the 2nds began to turn the screw, creating numerous chances. In midfield, Kev and John Benedikz were always in control, Neil Sneade (no doubt spurred on by the need to impress his new daughter [Ed. - who slept through the whole display]) was irrepressible, finding space and time in abundance and Al Sinclair will no doubt be in the nightmares of the 3rds defence for some time to come.
Despite this, the goals did not come until the 2nds moved up another gear with twenty-five minutes on the clock, switching into the pass and move mode that we know we can play. Good play from Tim Clapp and Dave Aston resulted in the ball being offloaded to Mark Pears at the byeline who crossed a tricky ball back across the D. In a maelstrom of shots and saves, finally a shot on goal was stopped on the line by a 3rds' player's foot - penalty flick! Tim Clapp stepped up and sent the keeper the wrong way, planting the ball firmly into the bottom corner.
Into the second half; the 2nds kept up the same high standard of play and it was only a matter of time before more goals came. Five minutes into the half, Tim Clapp (playing a blinder of a game) picked up the ball in his own half on the right hand side and set off on a mazy run towards the corner flag. Beating what seemed like the whole 3rds team, one after another, he cut inside and teed up the ball for Mark Pears who, with plenty still to do, fired a superb strike into the top left hand corner. Fantastic hockey, worthy of Division 4!
At this point it looked like the match could end up a rout, such was the dominance of the 2nds' midfield. The game was put beyond doubt when Leo surged forward from defence, winning a free hit just over the half way line. He took the hit himself quickly and the ball eluded every defender's stick, finding Mark at the top of the D. Mark played a superb dummy, leaving the ball to run through to Dave as two 3rds defenders ran across each other, who, with calm and presence of mind that belied his years, simply rounded the keeper and struck the ball into the net.
Three goals to nil and the 2nds were coasting, but there was still time for a consolation for the 3rds. A short corner was conceded; the initial shot was partially blocked by Lino in goal but the deflection found John Greaves right on the line who pushed the ball goalwards and, despite two great saves from John Benedikz, eventually it went over the line.
So South 2nds finished up worthy winners. After the match, captain Kev Rowland said: ""We were slow to come out of the blocks today which meant we gave territory away. It's at this time where we risk going down a goal early on. Though we raised our game to win today, everyone of us needs to focus on switching on from the first whistle to gain an early advantage rather than having to fight our way back into the game. After getting our rhythm, the passing and movement from the team today looked very impressive and created real chances.""

The only goal of the half came from a penalty flick, expertly dispatched, giving the ever-solid keeper, Shahbaz Ali, no chance

The second half followed a similar pattern, although the ""Home"" team (South 3rds) had some good attacks, and were able to get into the D, but sadly not in enough numbers to cause real trouble. Andy Lewis and Simon Ta were prominent in many moves, and the midfield managed to link the play with good passes.
The 2nds grabbed two well worked goals from breakaways, using their superior pace and ability to get into space, to build an unassailable 3-0 lead. Towards the end, the 3rds, showing fitness and skill belying their lower ranking, were on top, and scored a deserved consolation as a Simon Ta shot was stopped near the line only for ace poacher John Greaves to force the ball over the line from close range for another trademark goal. Other chances fell to Toby Bull, who regularly managed to find a good position, and Stu Creed, who epitomised the team effort. The 3rds were unlucky not to get more goals before the end, although it was a creditable performance against the higher club team, who will undoubtedly be chasing promotion this season.

Despite a slightly shaky initial 10 minutes resulting in a goal to Spalding (tapped past Souths keeper and slotted in at the back post), South soon settled in to a rhythm and really showed their fighting spirit. The counter attack was impressive, with some great passing through the centre of the field resulting from a strike from the top of the D and a well timed tap in at the left post by Charlie. 
However, Spalding were a determined bunch and made an impressive run from the half way line, producing a similar goal to their first (tap in at the right post) providing them with a 2:1 lead. Not to be outdone, a determined South fought back and gained a short corner, with a slip to Hayley on the left resulting in a shot on goal and enabling rebound attempts by Alice and Caroline Dent. Ultimately though, it was newcomer Caroline Molony who gained the glory by managing to convert a well deserved second goal for South. 
South sustained the goal scoring momentum and not long after, Charlie scored again following a well timed slip to the right post by Caroline D. 
Unfortunately by the last ten minutes of the game, South appeared to tire, to which the (younger!) Spalding side took full advantage. Gaps began to appear in the home sides midfield and again resulting in Spalding making a break from the midway line. They then scored an impressive final goal from a ball across the top of the D, which was slipped to their left and lifted just over Cassies boot, bouncing off the top of the backboard. 
So an encouraging start to the ladies 1s season following promotion into the Premier Cambridgeshire league, with a strong performance from the team as a whole. Particularly heartening were the solid performances of newcomers Lindsey B (executing some excellent tackles and free hits in her role at centre back) and Caroline M (with a skilful and hard working display at left midfield). Not forgetting the very useful steal of 2nd team captain Charlie O. ","Ladies' 1sts draw in a Cup game against Spalding","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

City didnt know what had hit them with South sustaining their attacking form with some superb dribbling through the middle by Hayley and a powerful reverse stick sweep by Alice in to the goal at left post. 
As half time began to draw closer however, South appeared to lose their heads slightly and again tiredness began to take its toll. City scored their first goal from a short corner and followed this not long after with a break (following a South attack which then left a depleted defence) resulting in a second goal just before the half time whistle.  
South appeared to gain some more drive and determination in the second half and had several chances with some near misses by Kendra at the left post and Alice from the top of the D. Ultimately though City managed to gain a series of short corners which resulted in their final goal with a slip to their left and a shot into the back corner. 
So an encouraging first league game of the season for the ladies 1s (despite a perhaps unrepresentative result), hopefully in future matches as the team becomes more consistent we will be able to continue our attacking momentum throughout the game and achieve some well deserved victories.

South got the first push-back but failed to take advantage and were immediately put under pressure by the visitors. However Captain Georgies pre-game adjustment of the team formation from last season was vindicated, as Souths defence regained possession and set up a counter-attacking break, setting the pattern for the game. For a while in the first half South managed to find their rhythm and put Spalding under some consistent pressure but could not find the back of the net.
The first goal was created on another break with Georgies through ball finding Caroline D on the left hand side of the D for a long sweep into the corner of the net. Spalding fought back hard but Rhi and Julie out wide never gave the Spalding forwards any space on the ball, and their best chance was denied by an amazing save off Cassies shoulder. They won a succession of short corners at the end of the half but South again stood firm.
The second half continued in a similar vein, with Spalding having a lot of possession and territory, but South looking dangerous on the break. Lindsey at centre back picked out some beautiful strong passes to spaces created by intelligent running up front by Alice, Sian, and Caroline D. A few slightly erratic umpiring decisions against both teams rattled Spaldings composure but South kept cool and eventually capitalised. The second goal was set up by a lovely passing move right from the back involving Ellie, Julie, Caroline M, and Sian before being well finished by Caroline D. Newcomer Sian capped a strong performance at right wing by picking up a rebound off the Spalding keeper and slotting it from a very narrow angle for Souths third goal.
The defence was a sterling effort by the whole team, with Hayley and Caroline M in midfield tireless in running forward then tracking back time after time, and Ellie tackling strongly to sweep up any loose ends. Spaldings pressure was rewarded with a late goal from a well directed strike off a short corner. But South stayed strong, and cheered on by supporters Loopy and Freya, closed out the win.
A strong performance from every member of the team, and if we can maintain this level of hockey we can look forward to a successful season.","Ladies' 1sts take all 3 points against Spalding","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

South started brightly and intensely winning an early PC, Alice was denied by the foot of Caroline D, but Caroline D certainly made up for it later with some excellent wing play, holding space and giving a much needed outlet from the defence and midfield.
The Uni played energetically, with all their fitness and that. However, our defence held strong, with Ellie commanding and coming to the rescue of the midfield on many occasions.
Nil-nil at half time did not reflect the end to end nature of the first half. South regrouped, calmed it down and resumed with some sweet passing hockey. ""We were playing in triangles"" said Caroline D. This was a good thing as the triangles lead to Sian being put through into the D, and with plenty of work still to do, she coolly finished. South were motoring. 
Caroline M was strong in midfield cutting out Uni passes and driving the ball up the pitch; she gets everywhere!
Alice was like ""what is she doing?"" and something about ""oooh Daddy took your credit card off you for a week, oh dear"". In addition, she made it hard for the defence to clear their lines, hassling and making key interceptions enabling South to bombard the Uni D. Tash was unlucky (cos she tried to hit the **** out of it) after being put through by those triangles I mentioned earlier, I think this triangle involved George and Liles.
The uni got a break and won a PC, the first strike deflected off a South stick into the roof of the net. Technically it was difficult to determine the intial trajectory of the ball, however, the goal was disallowed. George was at right back by now and made some fabulous interceptions, despite the slight disorientation. Twice the uni blocked shots with their feet, and South were so close to capitalising on the resulting PCs; the ball would not go over the line. In the end one was enough.
Overall, a great team performance and a great result in this league. The team is going from strength to strength, and other cliches.","Ladies' 1sts win local derby against Univ Ladies","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

South began with what can only be described as a slow start. Whether it was the early morning game (thank you Cambridge City); the number of drinks from the night before (honestly) or straight forward complacency, Huntingdon capitalised early with a goal in the first 5 minutes. Despite the majority of pressure being exerted by South in the oppositions D, Huntingdon were able to gain another swift break (gosh that number 52 was quick) and by the time South had realised what was happening, Huntingdon had slotted another one past a disgruntled Loopy.
Not long after, skipper Georgie had a dramatic tumble in the centre of the pitch following a trip over an opposition players stick and landed full force on her ankle. After inspecting the damage and finding an ankle the size of a small grapefruit, she hobbled off the pitch to resume shouting duties from the side line. So, whether it was the 2-0 score line or the addition of a sprightly Hayley in to the centre midfield, the Southerners appeared to experience a resurgence which resulted in one of the most exciting come backs the team has seen in the past few years. 
South piled on the pressure with some excellent 1-2 passing through the midfield and into the D. Eventually, this resulted in a well directed pass by Hayley in to the D on to the end of Alices stick, who then slotted the ball in to the back corner. 
The half time whistle blew and South realised what they had to do.  With instructions for the forwards to push up and make themselves a nuisance at the goal mouth, they proceeded to do just that and dominated the play. Huntingdon appeared to tire and had fewer chances with only the occasional flurry in to Souths defensive half. These were calmly dealt with by some excellent interceptions and clearances from the South back four. The second half resulted in an abundance of goals for the home side, with some excellent play by Sian Tomlin on the left hand side of the pitch with resulted in a goal for her after a pass from a South short corner. South continued to take full advantage of their short corners, with Alice Hug smacking another one in to the back of the net not long after. After a scuffle at the goal mouth, Caroline Dent cooley slotted in the final goal which marked the end of a consecutive five goal frenzy. 
At the final whistle, a bewildered Huntingdon side left the pitch not knowing quite what had hit them whilst the jubilant South team celebrated their 3rd successive win of the season. All in all, it was a fantastic display by the Cambridge girls and similarly by Huntingdon ladies, with both teams showing great determination and providing a very entertaining 70 minutes of hockey.

Sawtrys well established, strong team gave the defence plenty of work but good marking, a high work rate from the midfield and some great tackling kept the threat on the D to a minimum (except for a short period in both halves when they boxed us in the corner for a scary minute or two).  Oh!  And there were goals!  One early in the first half, and another just as we were starting to feel twitchy about hanging onto the lead in the second half.  Sians was the culmination of a smart sequence of passing down the right of the pitch, and Kendras was a testament to good reflexes during a sustained attack on goal which may or may not have come from a short corner.

The match started with a minute or two of startlingly good play from South.  So much so that we seemed to shock ourselves into mediocraty and the Deeping team up a gear so that the first half was dominated by lots of end-to-end play but little in terms of real chance for either team.  South's only goal came about a third into the first half, when a lovely run by Alice allowed Ellie to move the ball from the defensive 16 yard line to well past half way, after which calm dribbling by Alice, a well timed pass to Tash and a smart lay-off to Sian resulted in a very classy goal.  Towards the end of the first half, Deeping cranked up the pressure on South, passing well through midfield and using their defenders to move the ball around the back and this pattern continued throughout the match.
The disrupted South team (still missing injured  Georgie, and with Caroline, Caroline and Kendra all busy elsewhere) struggled to control the midfield and get the ball upfield to somewhat frustrated forwards.  
As a result, South's defenders had to work hard and keep their cool under sustained pressure on the D and through some rather over-zealous umpiring decisions which lead to short after short being awarded against 
them.    Deeping's goal came from one of those corners - not the first 
deflection which richocheted of the cross-bar but the subsequent lightening rebound finish from their star player Gemma.  (We could have done with our own Gemma this week - remember her? - but she appears to find hockey tours in the steamy heat of Singapore preferable to Peterborough in the fog, darn it!)  Overall, this was a game we felt satisfied not to have lost (though still sad not to win) against a team whose position at the bottom of the table reflects the fact that they've had just nine players on the pitch for several matches, rather than inherently poor hockey.

Georgie's team talk really spurred us on and encouraged the team to 'be more aggressive from the start' and to 'pass in triangles'. Cambridge City came out really hard from the first whistle and produced some solid attacks. South marked their players tightly and managed to keep a clean slate, defending against a number of short corners with great resilliance. Alice, Tash and Caroline D continued to make excellent runs into space upfront which culminated in some convincing attacks. Unfortunately, about 15 minutes into the first half, Liles incurred a dead knee and, shortly after, Ellie received a ball to the cheek bone and so, for a short time, South were two players down. We rearranged the midfield and defence and managed to keep strong against an increasingly aggressive City side. Heroically, Ellie and Liles both returned to the pitch as soon as they could and we were back to full-strength (Ellie to left wing and Liles back to right midfield).      
Despite City having around 80% of the attack, the south defence worked tirelessly to intercept their passing and made many impressive clearances (Julie, Caroline D, Lindsey and Ellie). The marking was fautless throughout and, much to their frustration and South's relief, Cambridge City failed to score.

South started the game as the stronger team, with the midfield combo of Liles, Georgie, and Carolines M & D passing the ball well, despite the opposition snapping at their heels. On the rare occasions that Deeping managed to break out of their own half, the defensive wall of Serin, Julie, Ellie and joint Man-of-the-Match Lindsey were unbeatable, stealing the ball, and calmly distributing it forward for another attack. Unfortunately this dominance couldnt quite be converted into goals, as Deepings defence packed the D to prevent the striking trio of Sian, Alice and Tash from getting that final shot away after some searching crosses fired in by other joint Man-of-the-Match Liles. Half time, 0-0.
The second half saw a revitalised Deeping team come out, and they poured forward, winning a succession of short corners. But Deepings attempts to bamboozle Souths defence by taking them from the other side failed, as the South back line held firm, requiring merely the odd melodramatic dive from Loopy in goal.

After their win we were optimistic and keen to get started. After our warm up the captains were called. Panic stations!!! We had a different line up this week, so quickly went through names and positions, and practised a few short corners. Bourne had first push back, but we put pressure on them from the start, and quickly started to gain more possession. Communication between the team was strong which resulted in some excellent passing play. Ash and Ley did very well at supporting each other up front and it was not long until we created shots on goal. We knocked 2 past the Bourne keeper in the first half, provided by Anne and Ley. Newbie Anne was a welcomed addition to our side. We was very confident on the ball and did a fantastic job in midfield. A well deserved player of the match. Although she thought it was a fix so that she would come back!!! Ingrid made a sterling effort up front and was awarded with a rest for the 2nd half when Steph came on. Bourne didn't seem to play with defined positions, and pushed up front a lot. This did not phase us. Jo, Liz and Anne dropped back to help the defence and stuck to their players. Our defence were pretty solid. Hit outs worked well when we used Vicky and Lou on the wings.  
When Bourne did challenge us and get shots on goal, Loopy was there to save the day!! Tracey and Liz communicated well and managed to switch their marking. Poor Vicky was running all over the place after her player. Lou connected well with Jo up the left wing. When Bourne were on the break Pip was always there to pressure any free players. Ley got another goal under her belt in the second half. Steph's goal resulted from some textbook team play. Tracey hit the ball out to Vicky on the right, who hit the ball perfectly through the midfield for Ash to run on to. She passed to Ley who had run into space on the right. She hit the ball across the goal. Steph had made a run on the left and hit the ball in the back of the net from the left post.  
Awesome!!! Overall, we played really well as a team and hope to take this forward to our game next week against a strong Peterborough side.","Ladies' 2nds beat Bourne","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

The visiting team comprised players from a mixture of teams - their sharp forward's touch was particular exquisite
- but they quickly exerted pressure on the South team all over the pitch.  With half a dozen new faces South struggled to connect straight away and to cope with this early onslaught and found themselves two-nil down before the half-time whistle.  Goal custodian Shahbaz Ali was unfortunate and could do nothing about either goal.
South realised at the break that they needed to step-up their game in order to compete and the second half was duly an altogether different affair.  Inspired by both a combination of newly discovered energy and a few tactical changes - such as Ron Oren stepping up capably into the midfield role - it was South's turn to take the game to their opponents.
Manu Bhardwaj, Ron and Simon Ta were seeing a lot of the ball down the right hand side, and likewise on the left Tom Anns was supporting Nishant Patel and Sanjay Agarwala on the left.  At the back, new Dad (of 9-day-old Elijah) Dave Monck and Andy Passmore were gaining in confidence.  Everyone, it seemed, found just a little more effort and all of a sudden the game was being played further up the pitch, fifty-fifties were breaking South's way and half-chances were beginning to be created.  It was time for South to sustain pressure on their Hitchin friends' goal.
One particularly promising counter-attack saw Bhav Virdi lift an aerial ball supremely out from defence and look to set-up a fast two-on-one break.  The ball sailed high out of the twenty-five metre area.  It sailed high over the lurking opposition strikers.  It sailed high over the marooned midfielders.  Unfortunately, the ball sailed high over the outer perimeter fencing too and on to the athletics track!  And this earned Bhav - who had otherwise had an outstanding game in central midfield - the lemon award.
Chances were being engineered by South but Blueharts always managed a last ditch tackle to scramble the ball away before any clean shot could materialise.  Still it was no surprise when the host's reward came.
From midfield, Bhav played the ball to Rob Barton in the D and after he tried to turn and shoot the ball fell nicely to Nishant who pushed it towards the empty net.  Simon Ta had positioned himself under the crossbar and waited patiently until the ball was actually on the goal-line before stamping his name on the goal.
South were on top now and ended the game strongly and enthusiastically despite not having the luxury of any bench men.  Overall, a decent run-out against friendly but well drilled opposition.  South will look to take the energy and commitment of the second half into their next friendly at Bishops Stortford, and will need to maintain this rhythm if they are to challenge for a top slot in the league come March next year.
After the game, skipper Bhav Virdi was pleased despite the result: ""We took time to settle down in the first half but I was quite happy to see them stunned with how we played in the second half.  It is always very satisfying see that we can raise our game against top quality opposition"".","Men's 2nds lose to Blueharts in a friendly.","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

The home side went on the attack from the start and were 2 - 0 up early in the second half. The actual goals were unlucky, as the away defence of LeeBenedikzEvansBridge were confidently snuffing out attacks before they got into the danger areas. The opener came after Shabhaz Ali saved from point blank range only to see the ball rebound back off the attacker once again. The second goal was a rapid breakaway. 
 
Skipper John Greaves signalled the start of the comeback with a sweetly taken angled effort from Sanjay Agarwala's masterful pull back from the by-line. Paul South then converted a trademark GreavesLewis short corner move only for Harlow to retake the lead immediately after the restart as the CSouth team were still celebrating. Taking this as an affront, Paul South then combined with Greaves and James Raikes to finish off a neat move himself to equalise once again.
 
The winner although from the shortest range...about 6 inches...was the culmination of a rapid passing move between Raikes and Greaves, the latter providing the pass across goal to the lurking Stu Creed at the far post.

New recruit Phil Crowhurst  was promptly pressed into service, despite a troublesome back; to back him up, 4s were gratefully relieved of their semi-injured Simon Jelley.  To add more complexity, the team had to assemble from three different locations, with Andy Passmore even coming down from a weekend in Sheffield to add his might to the fray.
Having overcome all these difficulties, the team started the game brightly. The speed and energy of Richard Claes and Tom Watson put the Spalding midfield under pressure, while Rob Barton and Jelley expertly frustrated any attempts of the home team to build from the back. Pretty soon, this pressure paid off: a mazy run of Phil brought him through into the D, where he found Rob lurking to bury the ball. 1-0 to South.
Spalding, however, did not take this lying down and found their feet in the game. For a while, the game hung in the balance, with South incapable of extending their lead, while Spalding could not find an equaliser (although both sides had their opportunities). Spalding were the first to break the deadlock, when a cross was - rather nicely - deflected into the top corner. All square.
South responded instantly, with Rich driving the ball at lightning speed up the left side and into the D. With teammates scrambling to get into finishing positions around the P spot, Rich decided to keep the honours to himself and coolly despatched the ball at the tiniest of angles. Half-time, and South was again in the ascendancy.
In the second half, fatigue was clearly taking its toll, with both teams struggling to keep up with the see-sawing ball. In between much ping-pong hockey, though, there were moments of composed and beautiful play. In one of those, Souths right wing duo of Ian Glover and Sanjay Agarwala gave a master class in using triangles, surging up the pitch and into the D. In a clear bid to upset the fantasy league tables, Ian insisted on finishing the goal himself, giving South a 2-goal lead.
To Spaldings credit, their heads did not drop as they went in search of the goal to put them back in the game. It was all Souths back 4 could do, to stop them battering down Shahbaz Alis goal, and even then the latters catlike reflexes were needed at many occasions. Eventually, Spalding did find a way through, when a short corner was charged down and blocked by captain Ron Oren, only to fall to another attacker who unceremoniously dumped it in the net. With a resurging Spalding and a last-minute short corner, it was a nail biting finish, but one were South got the best of the home team: 3-2 final score and the 2s overtake at least three teams in the league.
An even and quite well-spirited game, this must be one of the most enjoyable and attractive ones that the team has played so far, and a win they can be proud of!

James Cobb valiantly stepped up and organised the team pre-match as Captain Fantastic Rob Garret was umpiring in the preceding match. To make amends for forgetting the Bishops Stortford voodoo doll James delivered a stirring pre-match speech where he exhorted the team to make Bishop Stortford weep.
Despite James organised build-up, in the early exchanges Cambridge South were unable to get their normal fluid passing going. With Bishop Stortford controlling both territory and possession, Nick Bristowe and George Wych both made a series of timely tackles as Souths defence held the attackers at arms length. In an effort to open the scoring South adopted a counterattacking game. John Hawkes combined great close control and an appetite for attack, repeatedly cutting in from the left flank while Russell Johnson offered a threat on the right.
As the first half wore on Cambridge South started to impose their authority on the game. Eliot Read starting his first game for 10 months repeatedly showed great distribution from the back under pressure while Dave Aston filling in at left back showed composure on the ball and a positional awareness that could see him take on the role more permanently; however, despite the pressure by South and a goal mouth scramble, the half ended without a score.
South finally broke the deadlock in the second half. A swift break up the left released Tristen Knight. Cutting inside Tristen made the pass of the match to pick out Russell Johnson unmarked at the top of the D where Russell slotted it to the left of the on-rushing keeper. South nearly doubled their lead a minute or so later with carbon copy of the goal alas this time there was no end product. Sensing the game was there to be taken South kept pushing. Jack Chalk attempted a reverse stick shot which he claimed was the closest hed come to scoring on the reverse for a year. In the centre of the pitch Rob Garret again showed it is possible to both shield the defence and drive the team forward, while Tristen Knight showed his versatility in playing 4 different positions - all after playing in the 2XI match.
With the Cambridge South stretched Bishop Stortford finally equalised.
An attack down Cambridges left quickly left Souths defence outnumbered and exposed. Fresh legs and quick interplay concluded with a tap in at the far post for the extra man. The clinical finish gave Shahbaz Ali no chance at all (especially as this was also his second match of the day).
In the final stages South started to flag with John Hawkes suffering from cramp. However, Souths defence remained resolute and soaked up the pressure, as did umpire Rob Barton who refused to favour the away side despite repeated suggestions and opportunities. A tense finale ensued with a series of short corners to Bishop Stortford. Souths defence held firm each time albeit at the cost of another short corner. With full time blown Souths forward line were force to race back each time in an effort to help out- or at least those still able and willing to run. Finally Souths defence managed to scramble the ball away and the match ended with honours even.
Captain Rob Garret commented that it was a shame that Cambridge South couldnt provide the away victory that several committed South supporters had stayed to see. These loyal followers stayed to watch a tense match that could not compare to their earlier pulsating end-to-end thriller.
Man of the Match was awarded to Russell Johnson after the Bishop Stortford defence complained about chasing him around the pitch. Rob Barton and Simon Ta shared Lemon of the Match. Rob Barton was nominated for wearing a pink umpires shirt and upholding the spirit of neutrality (seems rather harsh as he was umpiring at the time - Ed.) and Simon Ta for forgetting where he needed to a lift to and for attempting to steal Souths goal (entirely justified - Ed.)

Nomads had some good moments going forward in the early stages, but the back four of Dave Under the thumb Aston, George Never drinks on Fridays Wych, Nick Needs a shave Bristowe and the Thorpedo stood firm.   Wychs running out from the short corners was once again exemplary.   When the South defence was breached, Parker was always in place to snuff out any danger with some solid clearances.
Further forward Mark not the snooker player Williams, Tim if youre happy and you know it Clapp, Sanjay and Jack Fantasy hockey must-have Chalk were battling fiercely, and Eliot was read-ing the game well on the right (is it time I stopped this?).
The forwards of Simon Ta, the real G Mac and John Hawkes were always causing trouble on the break with their pace, and Nomads soon realised they were in a game.   However, it was a rather scrappy game at that, and no real chances were falling to either side.   That is, until the aforementioned Chalk picked the ball up in the middle of the pitch, strode forward through a couple of challenges and thundered a shot towards the Nomads goal.   The  first shot was dealt with by the keeper, but then Chalk (possibly with words of wisdom from Lord Rob Barton ringing in his ears from the pre-match team talk),  realised that a much more effective way of beating the keeper would be to plant a slow trickling sweep shot into the middle of the goal.   Which he duly obliged to do.
Suddenly Souths tails were up and they went into half time playing the stronger hockey.   Nomads came out fighting after the break though, with a thundered cross from the left being deflected just wide by their centre forward.   This served as a wake-up call to the defence, which had been tweaked further with the introduction of Eliot at right back.
The second half ebbed and flowed until excellent tenaciousness from the forwards won South their first and only short corner.   A fine push out from Graham found Briz at the top of the D, and he proposed a fantastic opportunity to Graham with his drilled pass back to the taker.   Graham duly said I do and deflected the pass into the bottom right corner of the goal, putting South two up midway through the second half.
From this point onwards, South seemed controlled in seeing out victory, although one player helpfully pointed out that they needed to stay professional to the end as there were fantasy points to play for.   Dave Aston this week decided to cut back on the verbal abuse on his teammates, but replaced it with the physical stuff- drilling a clearance into the right ankle of Mr Clapp, sending him to the sidelines.  
The final whistle brought with it another deserved three points.  A thoroughly professional (and satisfying) performance from South keeps them in the promotion spots, but perhaps more importantly puts distance between themselves and Nomads, who may well be in the shake up of the top teams come the end of the season.

However CSouth never gave up, and produced a number of fine passing moves which were unlucky not to be rewarded. Rupert Espley, Dom Nelson, and Paul South figured in many such moves. The wings, particularly John  Parker and Jake Davis found space and used it well, and John Benedikz, released to maraud up front in the second half, showed the direct way to attack.
The middle period of the game was CSouths worst as unfamiliar players found it hard to gel, and too often  reverted to chasing the ball around, but the home team did have their chances to score, and numerous short corners went begging. At the other end the defence were manful, with Creed, Simon Jelley and James Lee in the thick of things, and Shabhaz made his usual quota of point blank saves.

South started positively and tried to put the opposition on the back foot with some good passing moves down the flanks. The forward line of McCulloch, Hawkes and Ta worked tirelessly but were marshalled well by a committed Peterborough back line that kept their D well protected. South were at their most dangerous attacking down the left and then switching the ball quickly across the pitch through Cobbe or Chalk, a special mention must be given to Dave Aston who shrugged off a savage bout of man flu to give frequent support from left back. On a few occasions this style of play released right winger Johnson who used his electric pace to get past the last defender before crossing. Against a lesser opponent South would surely have converted at least one of these chances to take the lead but time and again a defenders stick intercepted the ball in the nick of time.
It took most of the first half before South managed to win their first short corner and then two came along at once. Frustratingly, the deadly duo, McCulloch and Hawkes, who had been prolific in training, were both off the pitch when these opportunities arose and despite registering good attempts on goal the B-team couldnt quite break the deadlock.
At half time the mood was positive, Peterboroughs attack had been limited to the occasional quick break or long ball and centre backs Gravelling and Bristowe had had everything under control, the only question was whether or not South would be able to break the Peterborough defensive line to score. 
Rob Garrett joined the action early in the second period, sporting a large bandage on his head that protected a self inflicted cut picked up at training. Despite the silly appearance, his determined and energetic play lifted the team who visibly raised the pace of the game in an attempt to put their opponents under increased pressure. Garretts work on the right brought Read into the game further up the pitch and South now looked dangerous down both sides.  
In one of the best moves of the match, South tore forward at pace, linking 3 or four quick passes together to release McCulloch, whos diving reverse stick shot beat the keeper but clattered agonisingly into the side of the goal. Moments later Hawkes started another stylish attack with a delicious no-look pass under his arm to Garratt, Again South breached the defence but the final pass left Hawkes a bit too much to do and the keeper was able to make a good low save.
Despite frequently getting into the final third, South struggled to get the ball into the D at times and also lacked the cynical killer instinct that could have won more short corners when they did so. Much credit for this must go to the Peterborough defenders who crowded out numerous attacks and then kept possession well, meaning the home midfielders had to work extra hard to win the ball back before South could mount another attack. Eventually time ran out and the two teams had to share the spoils having both worked hard for their point. 
All in all, a draw was probably a fair result that was good enough to see Cambridge South go to the top of the league, albeit thanks to a surprise Rutland loss at Wisbech. With such a solid defence the recipe for South success is simple - score!

The home team began the first ten minutes without their keeper and were duly punished when Rich sharply intercepted a square pass on the 25 yard line finishing neatly into the unguarded net. South took further advantage when some tidy possession inside the Stortford circle ended with Rob Barton beating (the now present) keeper from close range.  
Stortford gradually began to reorganize and force their way back into the game with some powerful running from midfield and were eventually awarded a penalty flick. Fortunately for South the Stortford player hit the post.  This was only a brief respite and Stortford scored thirty seconds later with one of their many breakaway attacks.  It was at this point that South effectively lost control of the game.  Two further goals for the home team came just before half time, on each occasion triggered by careless loss of possession around the 25.  Tighter marking at this stage may have helped South preserve their lead at least into the second half.  Stortford, in fairness, were the more skilful, particularly their number nine who instigated most of their moves as a spare man in midfield.  
In the second half Stortford scored four more goals, one of which was a penalty flick this time converted by the same player who had missed earlier.

South was 4th in the table and Boston was 5th before this match. Captain Ron & Vice Sanjay were not there, which meant Dave Monck was wearing the Captain's armband. 
Both the teams started on a positive note with Boston and Cam South penetrating each other's Ds. 
Boston as usual played a very physical and aggressive game with quick passing and good runs into the D. In one such move the left half of Boston missed his marker (Bav Virdi) and deflected a cross ball into the goal. Boston were 1-0 up in 10 minutes. 
A lot of new faces in the South team meant that there was lack of communication to start with, but South settled down as the match progressed. Rich Claes was doing his usual runs into the D and trying to create chances, but the goal was hard to come by. In the dying seconds of the 1st half Bav hit the ball from the right and Rob deflected the ball into the right top corner, the ball hit the net and bounced off into the keeper's shoulder and came back into play. The South defenders saw it clearly but the umpire didn't see it. The first half ended with Boston leading 1-0. 
During the break an application was made to GB Hockey to provide goal line technology for the East Mean's leagues, specially 4NW. 
The first 10 minutes of the 2nd half was all South. We got few penalty corners but coming back from the Christmas break meant that we missed the Thursday trainings and our penalty corners were not as good as they were in November and December. 
Rob was deflecting the ball from the crosses provided by Chris, Wilco, Rich, Jake & Bav into the Boston goalie's helmet, stick & chest. 2 inches on either side meant that South could have had the lead. 
Boston doubled their lead from a very skilful goal where the Boston striker dribbled past two defenders to score a goal past Shahbaz's left shoulder. Andy Passmore was quick to point out that the ball didn't hit the net to the umpire, hence it shouldn't be given a goal.
South didn't give in and earned another short corner. Rich missed the insertion and Dave (who was there to take the strike) ran to get the ball, he passed to his right to a free standing Bav, who made no mistake to belt the ball into goal. Bang Sounded the Board. 
Boston woke up and scored their 3rd goal of the match when the striker hit the ball hard into the goal and asked Shahbaz "" Can you stop that, you B*****D?"". The striker was sent to the sin bin for 5 minutes. 
The match ended at 3-1. 
The scoreline is not a true depiction of how close the match was.  It was a good match on a cold and windy day on a pitch that was absolutely horrendous, mud filled pitch. And those who didn't go didn't miss the teas after the match.

Unfortunately they soon equalised by sheer weight of numbers in the D from a short corner. The shot only just got past the reach of the excellent new keeper Chris Collinson, who made a number of confident saves and kicks through the game.
CSouth went ahead after half time with one of the best moves of the match, as midfield dynamo (A) - Paul South  found midfield dynamo (B) - Jonny Deacon in space. Deacon slotted the ball calmly across to that man Greaves who made no mistake placing the ball into the net in from his unmarked position in the D.
After this it was Stortford who seemed to have the most fuel in the tank and they attacked for most of the half, but were only able to score from an unstoppable direct shot off a short corner, CSouth  defence otherwise stood firm, and scrambled the ball away, with new player Tom Watson prominent turning defence into attack up the right, and man mountain John Benedikz allowing nothing past.
The home team did have attacks often via Dominic Nelson, and Eric Critchley, constant threats throughout, but we were unable to capitalise. A combination of Stortford's powerful central defence and some lucky deflections preventing passes finding a green shirt thwarted us.

The game was played to a high standard and at a fast pace, with both sides committing to attack whenever possible.  Cheshunt started the brighter and forced a short-corner within the first few minutes.  But in the first of a number of memorable saves, Parker pushed the drag-flick wide of the post after diving to his right.

Cambridge managed to fight back into the game and created chances of their own with some excellent moving and passing throughout the midfield and forwards.  The best chance of the half came when Rob released Simon in the D and his cross found Mark at the far post but the first-time snap-shot went just wide of the post.  No goals came in the first half, and the second half continued with both sides pushing forward to find the decisive goal.  South thought they had it when a shortcorner was flicked in by Graham, but the official ruled it out for a swing-and-a-miss before the shot.

With everything all-square at full-time the game continued into extra-time, 10 minutes each way.  Neither team seemed keen on the flicks and with defences tiring chances were more easily fashioned.
Cheshunt thought they had it when a scramble in the home-side's D left a Cheshunt striker with a clear sight of goal and his shot was flying into the top corner until man of the match Chris Graveling made a reflex save on the goal-line before clearing the ball.  At the other end, Graham beat 2,3, or maybe even 4 men before lifting the ball into the D and volleying the ball at the far post and only a handy deflection from a defender spared the net from bulging.

Cheshunt got the breakthrough at the end of the first half of extra time with a classy drag flick into the top corner from a short corner.
 This prompted a second period of hockey in which Cambridge desperately pushed forward for an equaliser but despite a number of short-corners and promising opportunities it just wouldn't fall for them.

In the face of South pressure, Peterborough replied with a well-executed short corner, finishing off a blocked shot before the defense could sweep it off the pads; a repeat performance early in the second half then saw the lead going to the visitors.
To Souths credit, heads did not drop and the hunt for an equaliser was on. As the team pressed forward more and more, the ball found its way into the opposition D on many occasions. But the final touch proved elusive, with Tom South narrowly failing to connect at the far post with a pin-point pass from a superbly playing Matt Readman. Eventually, it was Rob Barton that levelled the score with a trademark reverse-stick shot. 
Scenting a win, South kept pressing hard, only to be caught short by a quick Pboro break. Desperate lunges by almost every member of Souths back four (not to mention keeper Shahbaz Ali) could not stop Pboros galloping forward and the visitors were on the front foot again. The final moments off the game were annoyingly reminiscent of last weeks result against St Ives: despite South camping out in Pboros 23, the ball just wouldnt cross the line. 
In the end, a disgruntled South team had to concede yet another match they ought to have won, as even the opposition captain - rather gracious in his unexpected win - agreed. On the bright side, the team played better than last week, with more (if not enough) composed and easy passing; there are still improvements to make, though, before the first points will come.","Men's 2nds lose to Peterborough","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

HT : 1-0
With such dominance, South played with 11 outfield players. Well, it was only a friendly..... but the team somehow read that as 'let's play with 11 attacking players'.  No tracking back, nothing.  This is not even like Wednesday night knock about, it was like a bunch of 6-year-olds in a park who all wanted to be Sean Kerly (for those of you old enough to remember).  This resulted in the Ipswich centre forward having an empty goal to shoot at, but he somehow missed and South went up the other end, where Rob Barton predictably hit a reverse stick shot and, as it went wide of the far post, James Bridge was there to tap it in.  2-0. Had South learnt a lesson? Of course not.  More attacks from Ipswich now and there was little defending that they eventually made it 2:1.  Ipswich completed the fight back by winning a shot corner right on the final whistle which they managed to score from.  It will have put a smile on their faces driving back on the A14.

South created numerous chances in the first half, with their superior pace and passing in midfield exploiting the spaces left by the Ely side. We opened the scoring after a penetrating run down the left from Rich C, whose cross was converted at the second/third attempt by Rob, cooly lifting the ball over the stricken keeper on his reverse side from close range. It stayed at 1-0 for a good portion of the half, until South's second gave them some breathing space. This author can't remember much about the second goal - somehow the ball arrived at Tris and his flick was lucky to squeeze through the keeper's legs at 'groin' height (who may have wished he was wearing/needed a bigger box...). Ely were fairly dangerous on the attack, with some promising youngsters down their right-hand side, and pulled one back to make it 2-1 via a short corner - a crisp strike along the ground to Shahbaz's left. However, the home team's leading margin was restored just before half time, and this time a truly memorable effort. Tris took the ball into the D and despite ending up on his reverse side produced a stunning reverse-stick strike that flew past their bemused keeper high into the net. 3-1 at the break.
After an inspired half-time team-talk from vice-captain Sanjay (they get better every week...), the second half progressed in a similar vein to the first. The visitors produced some decent attacking moves to force Shahbaz into action on several occasions, including several superb saves from short corners. South created some great openings themselves however, and eventually put the result beyond doubt when a nice through ball (from Tris?) was finished with a reverse sweep from 'desperate-for-a-game' Graham to complete the scoring for the home team. A consolation goal from another short corner wasn't enough for Ely. 4-2 the final result.

The match was won by two goals scored mid way through the first half..the first following a good move with Paul South pulling the ball back from the by-line for Dom Nelson to sweep it in past a bemused keeper. The second followed soon after, with Stu Creed surprising the keeper with his effort straight from a straightforward short corner. 
Peterborough came back with a good goal just beforte half time, but thereafter were kept at bay by the authoratitive John Benedikz and his fellow defender YardleyEvansHo. Richard Yardley playing for the first time for the 3rds, gave a man of the match performance at right back, blending skilled defence with a desire to attack whenever possible and safe to do so. His fellow new-boy Richard, Marley, also fitted in well in the centre of midfield, being a constant busy body to the Peterboro players, and starting attacks with his simple passes to men in green shirts.
CSouth were unable to add to the score after the break, although Jake Davis came closest a couple of times after ghosting into great positions. More goals would not have been an injustice with CSouth putting together many fine attacking moves, passing early and supporting one another.

In spite of a break of almost two months, South had a strong start, with attacking play from the first push back and some impressive passing up the pitch. However, whether it was the blinding sunlight or slight lack of touch after the long holiday, South struggled to gain momentum as the half drew on. City appeared well drilled and repeatedly pushed South into their defensive third. Even with this unrelenting pressure, South displayed robust defending with some well timed interceptions by Ellie Raffin and saves off the line by Keeper Cassie Woodfin.  City knew they were onto something though and continued to bombard, eventually rewarding their efforts with a well executed goal. This was followed not long after by a second.
Despite the unhelpful score line, South clearly felt encouraged by their now infamous second half comeback record and after an intense team talk, returned to the pitch with renewed competitive vigor. In Rhis words we began to play our game and it looked like a different team had taken to the pitch. Movement off the ball and passing was much improved, with some excellent pressure and interceptions by Alice Hug at centre forward.  City appeared shaken and after the award of a free hit following a foul against Liles Dee (whilst making a beeline for goal), Hayley struck a powerful shot from the right, which was ultimately pinged into the left hand side of the goal by the modest Caroline I just stuck my stick down Maloney. 
South capitalized on their new found confidence and not long after were awarded a short corner. The controversy of the game (and season so far!) involved a fantastic strike from the top of the D by Alice Hug which flew into Citys goal. The game continued and it was only five minutes after the centre push back had been taken that City made a rather unsporting appeal for a disallowed goal. Much to the disgruntlement of the South supporters on the sideline, the Umpiring team bowed to pressure and the goal was discounted (apparently it was a sweep into the goal). To their credit, South refused to let this affect their performance and they maintained their second half dominance by gaining another short corner. Following another straight strike from Alice, Liles Dee satisfied her goal hunger by smacking the ball into the back hand corner from a deflection.

Going into the game South were well aware that this would be a tough challenge (Rutland are top of the Division, having scored  77 goals in 12 games) and the home team did not disappoint. Displaying a mix of pace, teamwork and great individual skills Rutland had South on the back foot for much of the first half and the midfield and defence had to be at their very best to keep the attacks at bay. Steve Parker in particular was on fine form and as the half went on the Rutland players began to show their frustration and as a result some of the composure went out of their game. South themselves were now able to press forward and had a number of good efforts on goal. Much of our success came up the left flank where Bhav Virdee linked well with Graham McCulloch and Simon Ta to create several chances but sadly none could be converted into a goal. Then close to half time Rutland scored their first goal and it took a very clever piece of play to finally break down the South resistance. Rutland won a long corner on their left hand side which was self-taken and then the attacking player played a perfect aerial ball right over the South D to an unmarked Rutland midfielder on the other side of the pitch. It was a great move that wrong-footed South and, although first George Wych and then Steve Parker saved the resulting shots, the ball was finally bundled over the line and Rutland took a 1-0 lead into half time.
Despite the goal South had matched Rutland for effort in the first half, probably creating the better chances and so went into the second half with high hopes. However, right from the whistle the home team started very strongly, pushing almost all their players forward in an attacking surge. With slick passing and superb ball control they forced a number of shots and short corners, scoring one goal from open play and another from a fantastic piece of individual skill off a short where the ball was stopped, then dribbled past all the South defence and walked into the goal. 
At 3-0, South were rocking and Rutland also had a goal disallowed when their drag-flick from a short corner was ruled out due to one of their players encroaching the D before the ball was injected. It was to the teams great credit that they continued to work hard and narrowed the deficit with a goal of their own off a well-worked short corner played back to McCulloch as injector who maintained his record of scoring on every Sunday game this season. However, any thoughts of a come-back were quashed almost immediately as Rutland continued to commit numbers forward, forcing another series of short corners, one of which was converted to make it 4-1.

At this stage it could have gone badly for South as Rutland were completely dominant but the team showed admirable strength and composure first to keep out the Rutland attacks and then, slowly, to turn the tide and force a number of chances themselves. Unfortunately no goals were forthcoming and, although Dave Aston did have a gilt-edged chance in the dying seconds that he somehow contrived to put wide, Rutland ended up worthy winners by a fair score line of 4 goals to 1.

Steve Parker was on fine form in the South goal pulling of a string of fantastic saves, frequently smothering shots.  Both sides fought hard and tempers were directed more towards the umpires than the opposition at times. Perse were very strong at set pieces and South did not capitalise when they had short corners themselves. An early goal from a well-positioned Paul South set the ball rolling and by half-time 3-3 was perhaps slightly reflective of the game in that South looked confident in possession but did give away the momentum by over-attacking.
The second half saw a more defensive period of play by South, creating a more tentative feel.  South lost the initiative, falling behind for the first time in the game midway through the half as a penalty corner flew past the face of Rich Morgan on the line. Nonetheless, the determination of Dan Cross and Adam Miller set up a platform for South to charge back and seal the win with a quick break from some scrappy play in the midfield as Duncan Graves and Hugo Christie paired up for the winner.

The away team had other chances, with Greaves himself going close, but it was City who grabbed an equaliser from a scrappy effort by an unmarked man after a goalmouth scramble.
Then the red mist descended as City scorted three more in quick succession, all from breakaway moves sending the ball at pace up the pitch, including one spectacular long range rasper, and another from a sublime aerial pass. This was a shame for the otherwise solid defender MarleyGloverJelly, although the large fast skillful City forwards would have been a handful in a higher league.
CSouth didn't give up and newcomer Nick Greaves and midfielders Paul South and Richard Yardley created some fine moves, using the width of the pitch where Rupert Espley and Tim Clapp kept up the momentum well, often getting the ball into the D where teammates lurked menacingly. Unfortunately the City keeper was playing a blinder, and all the pressure in the last 20 mins only resulted in one further goal. however it was the best of the day, as Dom Nelson cracked the ball joyously into the net with a magical reverse stick shot.

The opposition pressed forward strongly in the opening phases, obliging keeper Lino Di Lorenzo to make several excellent saves and interceptions. However, as the half progressed the balance of the game became more even and then the 2nds took the lead when a direct move up the right hand side of the pitch was crossed into the D and Rob Barton was given enough space to turn and shoot into the corner of the goal.
One-nil, and now would have been the time for the 2nds to move up a gear and put the game out of reach but the 3rds responded superbly with their midfield and defence combining well to keep the 2nds' attack at bay and create several opportunities themselves.
In the second half there were brief periods where South 2nds displayed some of their pass and move game and one such passage led to a second goal. A quick ball out from defence to Kev Rowland and some good interplay between the midfield released Dave Aston up the left flank for him to look up and gave the ball to Mark Pears who, doing what he does best, had pulled away from his marker in the D to gain half a yard of space and with a crisp shot put the ball in the bottom left corner.
By this time, the 3rds had suffered a setback with an injury to Paul South who had been looking very sharp. Despite this, their midfield (in particular Stu Creed and Patrick Farmbrough) were still battling hard and for much of the game were in control of the middle of the pitch, so even at 2-0 the game was not safe. This was proved when the 3rds pulled one back in the last quarter of the game, Patrick being the first to react at a short corner when the ball rebounded off Lino's pads.
However, despite their best efforts, the 3rds couldn't quite force an equaliser and at the final whistle a relieved 2nd XI were happy to walk away with three points from a game which could quite easily have gone either way but where a draw would probably have been a fair result .
After the game captain Kev Rowland said: ""We battled hard but need to work much more on our shape and movement, letting the ball do the work to create opportunities. All credit to the 3rd XI who pushed us hard and belied their position near the bottom of the table.""

A reshaped 3rd team were unlucky to concede an early goal, which represented one of a small number of chances. Generally the Glover, Bailey and Evans defence stood firm, and kept the opposition away from the danger area. This enabled the effective central midfield of Creed South and Farmbrough to gain the upper hand in the centre of the pitch and create enough attacking moves and goalmouth action to keep in the game. Unfortunately, 2nds keeper Lino Di Lorenzo was impassable.
The second half was similar and it was only a defensive slip that allowed the 2nds to go further ahead before Patrick Farnborough pounced onto a rebound from the keeper following a short corner to make it 2-1.
This weeks star injury was a Paul South ankle twist which narrowly took the honours over a couple of (accidental) shoulder-high tonks inflicted on innocent 3rd teamers.

A great game against St Ives An early push with a goal followed by another dangerous attack (narrowly missing) set the tone for the game.
Passes into space and good movement allowed us to control the field and keep the possession. Strong play at the back disarmed the occasional counter that did make it through, leaving just a couple of opportunities for Shahzad to make some great saves (including a strong contender for save of the season).
As the first half wore on St Ives began to come back into the match, playing deep and breaking with good interchanging of positions among their forwards to keep the South defence on its toes.
South were still dominating possession but the increasing closeness of the contest was shown in an umpire's warning to South in general, and Matt in particular, about stick tackling. At least Matt's new astro boots were keeping him on his feet this week on a surface becoming slippery in the falling drizzle. Unlike Tim Clapp, who seemed to spend most of the half on his backside! New boots have now been ordered, we understand.
The second half followed a similar pattern, South seeking the clinching second goal and St Ives doggedly hunting for the equaliser, calling Shahzad into action on another couple of occasions. South thought their pressure had finally paid off when captain Simon Jelley knocked home a loose ball that had bounced up in a goalmouth mle, only to have it ruled out due to a defender's flying knee hitting the handle of his stick.
Injury was then heaped on insult for the South skipper when a raised strike cannoned straight into his hand, sending him off the field with nasty bruising and a possible hairline fracture to his finger - the hockey player's metatarsal. Tim was summoned back on to spend the remaining minutes pancaking around on his arse while using up as much time as possible, an aptitude he demonstrated with alacrity.
A shame the score line didnt reflect the game played on the pitch, but we kept troubling St Ives defence regardless, resulting eventually in Johns goal to seal the result in the closing minutes, which he battered home whether it wanted to go or not. Another lock-out for the South defence and a satisfying performance that has put us top of the league.
The 3s will return at home against City of Peterborough 8s.

Although Peterborough are a dangerous opposition, well organised and capable going forward, during the first quarter South showed that we could contain them well. During the first half South carved out a hatful of chances and the forwards were being consistent with their shooting - every strike seemed to go just wide of the posts or else straight at the Peterborough keeper! With numerous attempts at goal but nothing to show for it, it came with some relief to hear the satisfying sound of Johns goal-a-game effort hitting the back board to put South ahead.
Pinpoint passes distributed by Nick from the back kept a supply of balls coming but the Peterborough defence held strong at the edge of the D. The ferocity of the South attack was then torn apart by a number of dangerous counter offensives from Peterborough. With the midfield caught napping more than once, Stu Creed did excellent service helping defend over the full length of the right side. Stu then coupled well to a great birthday cake fuelled performance from Jan to offer an escape channel for the ball which at times was struggling to leave our 25. Peterborough eventually got the ball in the back of the net but fortunately a foot had played the ball into the D to disallow the shot. The narrow escape brought home quite how precarious our 1-0 lead was in the lead-up to half time.
At the start of the second half, South came out with tenacity. Peterborough, now playing into the sun, were finding it harder to penetrate. South were moving the ball better producing a couple more chances, including one magnificent double save from their keeper, but no rewards. The match was becoming a stalemate with both sides struggling to get dangerous balls into the oppositions D. A push from Souths attack finally broke through with Tim taking a shot only for the ball to find its way to David, in his first game back for South after a year in Singapore, arriving at the left post who calmly put it away.
Peterborough, faced with the 2-0 score line, regrouped and pressed forwards, troubling the South defence. With the tiring midfield struggling to subdue charge after charge, Peterborough found their way to Souths D winning short corners and looking dangerous. It was only a matter of time before they found the net and after a powerful top-D strike found a slight deflection from skipper Simons stick to wrong-foot Josh in the South goal, Peterborough had broken Souths clean sheet for the season.
With only three minutes to go South tried to play the possessional game to disarm their opponents but with tired legs and tired heads, the ball found ever more dangerous territory until a last minute short was awarded to Peterborough. Only the fearsome sight of James Lee charging the striker at top-D could save South and it did, as South were let off with a failed stop letting the ball slip out to midfield.

The final whistle blew with the 3s glad they came away with three points in a game where they perhaps should have been looking to come away three goals up. Credit also goes to a young and skilful Peterborough side who competed all over the pitch and kept pressing until the final minute.

St Neots took the push back but were quickly closed down and found themselves defending early attacks from Matt and Dom [Ed's note - we quickly persuaded them to stop attacking the oppo and play hockey instead]. Their surprise was evident as the Saints struggled to find their structure, leaving Cambridge South in control of the ball for the first 5 minutes. Souths attempts on goal though were headed off by calm yet urgent defending.
The Saints then found their structure and began troubling the South midfield when in possession; but Souths defence were unflappable and contained all incursions into the South 25 solidly and with little danger. When in possession South moved forward well with Matt and Paul working triangles to Dom and John finding space and drawing defenders [Ed's note - some of his sketches will be displayed next weekend].
David, who was having a quiet game thanks to a distinct lack of balls up to this point [Ed's note - no aspersions to Mr Doup's manhood intended] was pleased to see the belated Wilco, a mere 45 minutes late this week, brought on for Simon. With St Neots bunched over to Souths right side, the more balanced midfield found it easier to penetrate and before long Dom had opened the scoring. Paul intercepted a loose ball out of defence and promptly slipped it to Dom who danced past a despairing, and illegal, attempt at stopping him to slot the ball home. Dom confessed relief that the umpire had played the advantage as he wasn't sure he'd have done as well with a flick!
This sparked new energy in the South side, who were now using triangles and timed runs to penetrate behind the St Neots defence. This brought further reward before half time, David making a quite brilliant strike as the ball came to him on his reverse side a yard outside the right post.
Confusion in the midfield [Ed's note - i.e. chatting tactics until the whistle rather than switching on and thinking about the game] saw South give away the ball straight from the second half push back. With St Neots's two star players looking to score, their attacking movement became more direct but was contained by the solid defending in green. Mobilising the ball with a few well chosen passes, South delivered a timely opportunity for Greavess goal-a-game. A lovely move saw Jan play the ball from the right touchline across to Tom, just outside the top of the D. Tom stepped inside his marker and into the D before slipping the ball under his arm to John, who teed it up with one touch and despatched it with a second.
With frustration showing, one of the aforementioned St Neots stars decided to dog the umpires with calls of ""third party"" whenever anyone moved (or didnt) while the other kept losing the ball trying to hammer through into the D. Undeterred, he eventually he managed to punch through from the right to send a superb lifted shot into the South net - a solo effort from a player playing divisions below his standard that we shouldnt be too upset by. John was deprived of chalking up another when he struck a ball played in from South's skipper which then got trapped under the opposing keeper. The keeper finally rolled off and it looked like John might actually get the ball only for the umpire to give an inexplicable 16.
The opportunity made the South attack up their tempo and with a number of committed attempts, resulting first in John taking quite a knock and then a Dom sandwich [Ed's note - beefy and with a lot of pepper] which only resulted in another St Neots 16.
Cambridge South continued to press well, controlling the closing stages of the game. Dom made sure South finished on a high note when he reacted quickest to Tom's shot against the post, hurtling in to beat the keeper to the ball and jab it home. With complaints from the opposition that South had failing to stop play when a St Neots player had gone down injured, despite the umpires waving play on, Paul identified it as karma as the exact same situation had occurred in the first half with Dom on the ground injured. The opposition pointed out that scoring didnt make him look THAT injured, so to diffuse the situation skipper Simon stepped in to console them that Im sure his hand really hurt as he slammed the ball into the goal. - it didnt seem to have the desired effect.

Cambridge South 3rds put aside such pressing existential questions to take on March 4ths at the Abbey. March were hovering in mid-table and can be relied on to always give a hard contest so South knew this was not a fixture to be taken lightly.

On a week of bountiful player availability for the higher teams, the 3rds were pleased to welcome Ally, Ali and Colin to bolster their ranks. Just as well, as the team was minus top goalscorer John Greaves (sore achilles - we told him to give up the high kicking in his ballet class) and team captain Jelley had sloped off to Wales to drool over an immacuately-coiffured Victoria Coren under the guise of participating in some TV geek quiz. Neil was left to rally the troops as stand-in captain for the day.

With South's only sub a crocked Johnny D good for ten minutes at best (or so we've heard), it was a focused squad low on numbers but high on quality who took to the pitch. After arriving in the middle of the first half for the previous weekend's trip to St Neots, Wilco demonstrated radically improved time-keeping showing up nearly a whole two minutes before the whistle. March meanwhile were having their own problems with late-arriving personnel: the unexplained absence of a goalkeeper meant they had to take to the pitch with ten men and a stand-in keeper.

South exploited their unexpected numerical superiority to press home an early advantage, making use of the extra man with passing play to pull March out of shape and make them chase the game. Up front Ally W was harrying the defence and making clever layoffs to the wingers or midfield while Ali E and Tom were working hard up and down the wide channels. A period of steadily increasing pressure was rewarded when a South free hit near the top of the March D was taken quickly by Paul, slipping it to Stu who pushed the ball into the D before unleashing a shot right-to-left that nestled in the corner of the goal.

Buoyed by the breakthrough, South pressed on. The defence were containing the attacking threat comfortably and Colin at centre back was showing the confidence to step up and launch attacks into the March half. March's best goalscoring opportunities were coming from short corners. Against the general run of play March almost levelled from such a short when their captain sent a formidable shot arrowing towards the left post, only for it to be blocked inches from the line by Neil's stick. As the ball's momentum spun it up into the air and towards the goal line, Neil lifted his stick to make a second mid-air block before Jan whacked the dropping ball away off the side line just ahead of the incoming March sticks.

Regathering themselves after the scare, South exerted more control over territory and possession to neutralise March's set-piece threat. Tom was making fine progress down the right wing and his ball into the D was met by his opposite number, Ali, arriving at the left post to knock it home. Tom followed up with a goal for himself before Ally W showed presence of mind when the ball broke loose in a crowded D to lift the ball over the crowd of sticks and diving keeper into the goal. Ali E just failed to connect properly with another couple of crosses but South still arrived at half time 4-0 up and cruising.

With no sign of the March keeper arriving it looked like a real opportunity to press home the advantage in the second half. March though, to their credit, had other ideas. A rejig in formation signalled a marked improvement in their fortunes. March's excellent right winger was showing speed and skill to put South's defenders on the back foot. Sanjay sustained an injury that saw him depart the pitch and South's defence had to be jury-rigged as Jan stepped in to Sanjay's position as sweeper. First Stu and then Tom dropped to right back as Johhny came-on for a longer stint than originally planned.

However, South held firm and prevented March from making the breakthrough. As the March tide receded, Ali E and Tom each grabbed their second goals to put the result beyond doubt. March did eventually get their consolation, another fiercely struck short corner this time finding a way through just inside the right post.

The last word went to South though, in every sense, with Paul getting on the score sheet to give an emphatic look to the final scoreline. A great performance and a great result, integrating several new faces into the team and still producing some fluent, confident hockey. More of the same please, with big games against Newmarket and St Neots 4s still to come.

Newmarket 2s were one of the chasing pack but the pre-season friendly between the sides on the same pitch, which had featured a mixed 3rd/4th XI for South, had resulted in a well-earned 5-3 win for the visitors.
One thing that might have given the visitors cause for concern was the three week gap since the previous win against March Town. Unfortunately, a friendly against Ipswich Cranes scheduled for the previous weekend had fallen through due to lack of numbers. South would come to regret missing the opportunity to keep their game sharp.
Souths team included Benjie Groom making his debut for the 3s in defence while another defender was playing his last match for South, James Lee moving to Oxford at the end of the year. A stalwart player over the years for South, Jamess contribution will be missed.
From the outset, it quickly became apparent South would be in for a much tougher contest than the previous meeting. Newmarkets strong midfield made it hard for South to get any hold on the game and the reward for the home team came quickly. Less than five minutes into the match Newmarket won their first short corner and promptly despatched it with a clean strike into the far right corner of Souths goal, beating keeper Shahbaz.
Stung, South regrouped and battled their way into the game. The match became very evenly contested, neither side able to establish a clear superiority. Newmarkets midfielders continued to funnel the ball with Souths best play coming down the wings. Souths midfield position probably wasnt helped by the, in retrospect, odd decision to deploy midfield ball-winner and defensive shield, Matt Kern, high on the right wing for the second half.
Chances came and went, the most notable featuring an attempted reverse-stick cross from South captain Simon Jelley that instead popped up to strike the opposing captain right between the eyes, felling him like a tree. Fortunately the spectacular and bloody collapse looked worse than it actually was and after some pitchside treatment the bandaged player was able to rejoin the match. The injury score was somewhat leveled with Tom South being flattened with a tackle from behind as he ran through on goal, knees and elbows bloodied as a result.
As the game progressed the score remained unchanged but South began to win an increasing number of short corners. As the tally mounted, the inability to convert became first concerning and then embarrassing. Newmarket had several further opportunities to score themselves via fast breakaways that had the South defence backpedaling but were unable to extend their lead.
That was the story of the rest of the match, as the clock ran out to leave South frustrated at losing to an early short corner that they had been unable to recover despite a plethora of opportunities. Calmer finishing and more clinical decision-making, particularly at short corners, will be needed to avoid a repeat of this result.","Men's 3rds lose out to promotion rivals Newmarket 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

A reshuffled defence saw Simon Jelley dropping to fill in at left back while Neil Sneade moved to sweeper to make room for Benjie Groom at centre back. At the back, old member Phil Le Gouais was appearing for one night only in the keepers pads.
St Neots were close behind South in the league and featured a strong mix of experience, skill and power. It quickly became apparent this would be another challenging game for South, particularly with their makeshift defence still finding its feet.
Despite this South gradually began to assert some dominance, pressing the St Neots defence and pushing up the pitch. St Neots remained dangerous with accurate balls out of defence to their strong attackers and some skilful midfield play. The balance of play was favouring the home side but, with echoes of the previous weekend, South were having difficulty converting pressure into goals.
As half time approached, Souths worst fears were realised when a ball not properly cleared from defence was promptly returned into the D with a slight lift that bounced it through Neil, the covering defender, to fall neatly for the St Neots forward who slotted it past the advancing Phil in goal.
The second half followed a similar pattern, South pressing hard for an equaliser while St Neots defended resolutely and threatened with break outs. As with the previous week, South won a succession of shorts but were unable to get the equaliser. South were playing dangerously high up the pitch in search of a goal, with even their centre back taking the odd corner.
The killer blow came from a free hit out wide just inside Souths half. The St Neots taker spotted a gap in the home defence with an unmarked forward lurking by Souths keeper and quickly sent a hard, accurate pass straight through it, requiring the simplest touch from the attacker to divert the ball into the goal.
So for a second week in a row, dominance in possession and chances was to no avail for South as they were outwitted by a smarter and more clinical opposition. Two defeats to their main league rivals have seen South surrender their once-commanding league lead and slip down the table. Good individual qualities need to be more effectively combined and marshaled to produce the results the team are capable of if the promotion push is to get back on track.","Men's 3rds lose to St Neots 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

1169,"03/12/2011","League",3,49,"15:00",17,"Away","5","1","3","0","False","False","False","A funny game this. Against the divisions bottom side, still to rack up their first point of the season, Cambridge South 3rds were confident of getting a result to put a halt to their nascent losing streak. More important though was the performance, with South looking to put away the woolly decision-making (and finishing) that had dogged their previous two showings.
The game started brightly enough for the visitors. An attack straight from the push back saw Tom South, anchoring the play in the centre of midfield, surge into the D to find himself directly in front of goal with time to size up his shot: 1-0 to South with barely 45 seconds on the clock.
Buoyed by their first goal in five weeks, South began to relax a little and look more confident in possession. Benjie Groom, having played three games for the club and lost all of them, was making his final appearance before returning to Grantham and had been moved to right back to take best advantage of his instinct to get forward. Jan meanwhile was capably filling the sweeper role, his clear calls and solid play at the back creating a good defensive platform for the team. Tom, Nick Venner and Stu Creed were a formidable midfield combination and, making his debut leading the line for the 3rds this season, Paul South was making canny runs to move the defence around and create space for runners from deep.
Despite the positive notes, some of the old failings remained present: the opposition keeper still seemed to exert a magnetic effect on crosses, too many of which were aimed at him rather than pulled deeper towards the P spot. The temptation to try wind-ups for big hits through a crowd in the D rather than simple slips to teammates in space or quick flicks or pushes on goal was allowing too many shooting opportunities to be closed down before they could be taken.
As South searched for the additional goals to build a solid lead, Ely reminded their opponents that they still posed a threat, particularly on the break. Their pacy centre forward was allowed to get goal side of his marker just inside the halfway line with the sweeper caught square, resulting in an unequal race between the striker and Neil, who was unable to overhaul his man but managed to put enough pressure on to make him take his shot at speed on the move, sending it wide of the South goal.
With the scare of an equaliser over, South finally managed to make their dominance count and two further goals were added from Paul South and Rupert Espley before half time. At the break, South felt they could build on their performance in the first half to put clear water between the sides in the second period.
This resolution proved easier to say than do, however. South were, again, in command but equally were, again, labouring to add to the scoreline. As against Newmarket and St Neots, short corners came and went to frustratingly little effect. One of the best opportunities of the half came when another run towards the D by Tom was met with Paul moving laterally away from goal, dragging his defender with him and opening space for Tom to run straight through on goal but unfortunately his shot failed to find its target.
After a period of mounting frustration, Paul broke the second half deadlock with his second goal before John Parker, whose effective deep crosses from the left wing had been a feature of the game, got his reward when he met a ball across the goal to get on the scoresheet himself.
The result was no longer in doubt and Benjie would be able to leave South with a win finally under his belt but one final frustration remained. With South having failed to make anything of their dozen or more short corners, a few minutes from time and with only their second or third short of the game, Ely pulled a goal back when a clean strike clipped Jans stick as he advanced off the line and deflected to hit an inch below the top of the backboard. The late concession led to a rather flat feeling as Souths victorious squad trooped off the pitch.
A marginally improved performance from the previous weeks debacles mollified by a significantly improved scoreline. The feeling persists though that the team is yet to get back to firing on all cylinders but encouraging signs are appearing and there remains a final opportunity to get it right before the winter break.","Men's 3rds beat Ely City 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Assembling for the pre-match meet at Milton Park & Ride, South find themselves unfortunately parked near to a pancaked pile of doggy doo. No problem though, just be careful to avoid it. Unless youre Ian G, that is, who strolled over to the meet zone only to dump his bag by the flattened faeces whilst removing his hand-wrapped sandwiches and then carefully placing them on the ground right next to the aforementioned turd. As he teammates reacted with horror, disgust and helpless laughter, Ian appeared unperturbed, retrieving them from their imperiled position before consuming them with relish (figuratively if not literally) on the journey to Market Deeping.
That inauspicious start over with, there was the small matter of the game to play. On a weekend of limited availability some frantic shuffling had finally enabled South to get 4 mens teams out. The 3rds were again without keeper Chris Collinson, whose appearance is beginning to assume Yeti-esque rarity, and in fact were without a keeper of any sort. Despite this, South had a good outfield 11, Nick Venner making his second consecutive appearance for the team but now promoted to centre forward, with Ian G coming in at right back and Simon Jelley again filling-in in a now quasi-familiar left back role. Jake Davis was also welcomed to the team for his first 3rds league match of the season, playing wide on the left side of the forward three.
Arriving at Market Deeping by an unfamiliar yet effective route, thanks to Simon Jelleys Tom Tom app, the conditions were cold but clear and still: perfect hockey weather. The only issue was the shaded end of the Deeping pitch which was still hard with frost at the 2pm push back, albeit just about playable.
Following the last-one-to-the-meet-wears-the-pads rule, Wilco inevitably found himself in goal. With a keeper who had never put on pads before, Souths tactics were very clearly going to have to be based around not allowing Bournes forwards to have any shots on goal.
To this end, Matt Kerns terrier-like ball winning in the centre of the midfield three was complimented by Toms skilful play on the left and Stu Creeds controlled possession on the right. Up front, Nicks pace and work rate was unsettling the Deeping defence while Jake and Rupert got down the wide channels to work crosses in. Deeping were living up to their name by falling so far back that Neil found himself playing centre back on the opposition 25 yard line.
The breakthrough, when it came, was a masterly finish by Jake. A cross by Nick from the right came up towards waist height only for Jake to arrive at the left post and brilliantly put it away with a deflected volley.
As South settled and turned up the pressure on the Bourne defence, short corners began to come. Paul South having joined John Greaves on the crocks bench, Jan was promoted to receiver, where he demonstrated his fine hockey brain as well as excellent shot with clever slips and changes to create increasingly promising opportunities. With an almighty hallelujah, South finally scored from a short corner as a slip right to Rupert gave him the angle for a shot which he sent past the keeper to bring up the second goal.
No further score was added before the interval but South were feeling pleased with their form and confident more goals were available, while Wilco had seen his involvement limited to kicking clear one cross.
The second half got underway with a Bourne push back leading to an immediate attack that was quickly stifled by the South defence, where settled positions were finally beginning to have a positive effect with Jan at sweeper, Neil at centre back and Jelley at left back. From the turnover, South swept forward and, for the second week in a row, Tom South was on the scoresheet within a minute of the umpires whistle, powering into the D to score. Great start!
That set the pattern for the half as an increasingly confident South played their best hockey in weeks, pressing the play high into Bournes half while being careful to avoid being too exposed on the break. As the match edged towards the final quarter, Bournes best chances of the game came as they managed to get one shot off that skewed wide of Wilcos left hand post before managing their solitary shot on target which Souths stand-in keeper got just enough of a scuffed kick on to deflect it beyond his post.
The scare over, South added to their tally with another excellent solo goal from Tom, increasingly showing that midfield is his best position, before Jake finished off the scoring, this time popping up at the right hand post to knock home a cross from the tireless Nick.
So a great result against potentially tricky opponents who put in a creditable showing but came up against a strong South line-up that finally seemed to click after the frustrations of recent performances. The message for the winter break is to avoid too many mince pies and turkey, get to training or pay and play when you can and come back sharp and ready to resume the season with the return derby against South 4ths on 14th January. Happy New Year everyone!

Everyone was eager to get back on the field. Lacking a regular goalkeeper, with only one available in the entire Mens club, skipper Jelley donned the pads.
During the first few minutes the effect of the break was more than evident, with rusty skills and loose positioning compounding poor communication. The St Ives attackers found it easy to slice through the broken midfield, and quickly asserted themselves in the South D. The South defence were leaving some players free while closing in on others in twos, allowing a free player on the far post to knock in an easy goal, putting South on the back foot.
Frustrated by this affront by a team lower down the division, South soon slipped into some old bad habits. Careless balls with no-one on the receiving end, players running into contact without passing and attempts to pass through multiple opposition players lead to the next 15 minutes being the worst seen in a while, with a heap of opportunities for the St Ives forwards culminating in a short. Jelley saved the direct strike only to see the deflected ball tipped in by a St Ives forward moments before Stu could clear it.
The gravity of the situation was now clear, 2 goals down to the team 3rd from bottom of the division we want promotion from. There was a lot of work to do; the only saving grace being that, sensing a goal fest, the structure and discipline of the St Ives side fell to pieces in search of personal glory, giving South some well needed relief for the remainder of the first half.
With the skipper hoarse from the half time talk, South took to the field a different team for the second half. Great movement off the ball was rewarded with intelligent passing, and the home side had finally found their structure. Even a heated argument in the defence was a valuable bit of communication seeing the depth of play in the defence rationalised. The 3s were now looking potent, and a goal was only a matter of time, but time was running out. 
With 16 minutes to go South were awarded a short, and in the huddle the magic number was uttered. The injection and lay off was text book and although Stu Creed found the ball come to him rather than going to left slip, we capitalised on it, bringing the game back into reach. 
This goal stoked Souths spirits and soon they were tearing through the opposition on attack, and diffusing any attempts of St Ives to breach our half. St Ives didnt know what had hit them, and before they had a chance to regroup, well timed slips to David Doup from first Paul and then Tom South were put away to make it three goals in twelve minutes, and the score 3-2. Reinvigorated by the new found lead, Cambridge South met St Ives ferocious last minute efforts to recover the scoreline with solid defence in the midfield, playing out the last few minutes of the game calmly.
Not the scoreline we were hoping for before the match, but 3 points none-the-less and a great display of how well we can play when we try (not to mention how badly we can when we dont!).","Men's 3rds come from 2-0 down to beat St Ives 5","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Pah!), and John Goal-a-Game Greaves who was itching to play after an Achilles injury had had him out of action since the end of October.
Peterborough are the thorn in the side of the promotion-chasing teams in Div 6NWS, having held both Newmarket 2s and St Neots 4s to a draw. Cambridge South 3s needed a victory to turn this fact to our advantage. The game that followed wouldnt disappoint.
Skipper Jelley won the toss and elected to change ends given that the low sun would be dazzling, a point questioned by Jan given the match was being played half an hour either side of midday and so wouldn't have moved for the second half.
Peterborough started strongly and quickly made two or three incursions inside Souths 25, although handled carefully by Jan Brynjolffssen and Neil Sneade leaving Chris little to do. South soon found their footing as they figured out how to work the ball round the opposing midfield. The visitors managed to maintain pressure on the home sides defence although this did lead the South midfield to move higher and higher, leaving the back occasionally exposed on counter-offences.
With the South defence holding strong the pressure paid off when, having been awarded a short, the magic number was whispered once more, Like the previous week, from the new slick short corner routine Stu Creed found an opportunity to put the visitors into the lead and grabbed it.
After play restarted Peterborough made the occasional foray into the South 25 and even won a couple of shorts - though converted neither - but the general momentum was well and truly with South now. Several good balls up the left from Paul South to David Doup and some strong work on the right by club debutant Laurie Haslop and Stu filled the next few minutes but it was a great slaloming run by Tom South, who fed the ball perfectly to John, that provided the next goal. This reminder of what goal-scoring felt like seemed to send John into a frenzy of energy, with him pursuing every ball with a dogged determination.
After further potential goal scoring opportunities for first Rupert and then John were deemed thwarted unfairly, a penalty flick was awarded and Stu Creed stepped up to the mark. Stu flicked a well-placed ball thigh-high near the post but his attempt to ""give the keeper the eyes"" failed and lightning reactions allowed the man in the pads to make a diving save to his left. Undeterred, South continued to press forward and were rewarded when Rupert tipped a shot from John past the keeper and in.
Peterborough were under pressure now so were relieved when their opponents confusion on the new short corner routines led to an award being overturned for delay in taking it! The remainder of the half continued to favour the visiting side culminating in a short corner as the whistle went to finish the half. After the first two shots were saved and with the entire South team up for this final short, it was difficult to see how John managed to sneak the ball into the net for his second. But it didnt matter;  4-0 at halftime and a double dose of goals to play catch up on goal king for Mr Greaves.
At half time the sun went behind a cloud, as the skipper had promised his mutinous sweeper it would... it came out again about a minute into the second half.
The second half started strongly with balls worked up the right by Tom, Stu and Rupert and runs up the left from Andrew Fraser but Peterborough had realised how important it was to keep the ball from John and they cut the passes out at the edge of the D.
With the sun making it harder to pick out the green players the well-timed pinpoint passes faded way and South found themselves met by an energetic side of young players who still had much to prove. Gradually the play moved out of Peterborough's 25 and towards Cambridge Souths. With the opposition closing balls pivoted round the South back line the visitors found it progressively harder work to get the ball out of defence, and with the tiring midfield outpaced by youth it seemed to come back more regularly too.
South switched to the defensive and focused on closing their opposition down, with the midfield joining the defence to make a 7-2-1 formation. South succeeded in largely containing their opponents, leaving just enough scary moments in the D to make Chriss return feel appreciated (special mention to the stunning clearance from Chriss stick after a good save).

Having played only twice in the past two months, South were glad of the friendly fixture to try and rediscover their match form ahead of the resumption of their league campaign.
Neil Sneade's late addition to the squad was welcomed when holdups on the A14 delayed the arrival of Ian Evans until mid-way through the first half. The Sandy team was a non-league development side, leavened with a few more mature heads. Despite their lack of league practice, Sandy's young players showed some promising skills. However, the experience of South 3s quickly started to show as the home side took control of the game.
An understandably rusty start was gradually polished as South found their rhythm, asserting their control of possession to compress the play into the Sandy half. Indeed Neil, playing at centre back, found himself frequently holding near the Sandy 25 yard line! When a run and lay-off led to the ball being returned to him inside the top of the D, the resulting altitude sickness led him to prove why we don't usually let him play that far up the pitch as he tamely pushed his shot straight at the Sandy keeper.
Despite this heady profligacy, South's control was solid and by half time a comfortable 3-0 lead had been established with goals from wide forwards David Doupe and Rupert Espley. Novice stand-in goalie Andrew Fraser was yet to touch the ball and more was promised for the second half.
Sandy refused to roll over and continued to play some neat hockey while lacking that final penetration or cutting edge. In the second period, David completed his hatrick before being hauled off for an early bath while Rupert finished with a brace with further goals from Tim Clapp and, his first of the season, Wilco Dijkstra. Things weren't looking quite as smooth at the back with occasional confusion in clearing the defensive lines, some wayward passes and, in the most comical moment of the match, a magnificent parachute roll from Ian getting entangled with the ball without another player within 10 yards of him.
Andrew finally got to make a save from a late Sandy attack but his goal remained intact at the final whistle.

Cambridge South 3s were looking to avenge one of their only two league defeats of the season. That had come in an incredibly frustrating game at Newmarket leisure centre when a goal conceded from a short corner just a few minutes into the game proved decisive as, despite a plethora of subsequent pressure and short corners of their own, South were unable to find a reply.
With South not having played in the league for four weeks due to a combination or arctic weather and a fixture gap, Newmarket had taken the opportunity to surge to the top of the division, five points clear albeit having played two extra games. That meant a draw was the very minimum that could be contemplated from this game.
Fortunately, the import of the match had clearly communicated itself to the South squad as a spectacular level of availability with virtually every player available plus a couple of flow-downs from the 2s, themselves taking fourteen players to their derby game, gave South twenty players to pick from! The eventual squad of fifteen was a strong, well-balanced side so there could be no excuses for any slip-ups.
From the off, South were on the front foot. Some cool play by Newmarket saw them keep possession for the opening exchanges but from the first turn over, South were surging forward. Quick breaks, neat interplay and good awareness set a positive tone. The early breakthrough came via a magnificent ball from Matt Kern. Winning possession on the right of midfield, he spotted David Doup breaking down the left channel. One diagonal pass took out the whole of the Newmarket midfield to send David through on the keeper. David's strike was well-saved but following up was Ali Edge, who with ice in his veins gathered the deflected ball on the top of the D, picked his spot and calmly lifted his shot past the keeper to strike the backboard. A fantastic start.
Pressing home their advantage, South were winning the 50/50 balls and quickly shipping the ball forward. A second goal followed within minutes, this time from an early-taken strike by David. Before Newmarket could recover their equilibrium it was 3-0, with ""Goal-a-game"" Greaves pouncing in the D to finish. Mid-way through the first half, South were looking comprehensively on top with Steve Parker, guesting in goal in Chris C's absence, yet to touch the ball.
Newmarket were still showing good skills and discipline and were far from rolling over but could find no answer to the quality of South's play across the park. After some initial disruption when an unwell-feeling Tom Anns had to make way for Paul South, the subsequent reshuffling resulting in Neil going from centre back to left back to right back within the space of a few minutes, the defence had settled down. Paul, his deeper position at centre back giving him more time and space than his regular midfield berth and supported by Jan at sweeper, was quarter-backing the game authoritatively, using his anticipation to intercept passes and body strength to win tackles and hold off challenges before unleashing South's midfield runners with his trademark accurate passing game. Matt Kern was a dynamo in midfield, winning everything that came near him and launching attack after attack, with capable assistance provided by Stu and Ali.
Newmarket gradually began to pull themselves back into the contest albeit without truly threatening South's goal. Momentum was restored to South just before half time though when another South attacking surge led to Matt finding himself at the top of the D with the ball on his stick and, deciding to try his luck, was rewarded for his first half display with the sound of the ball hitting the backboard.
At half time, skipper Jelley praised the all-round display but the team were reminded of their previous league match (five weeks ago!) against Peterborough when a similar first half performance and score had been followed by a torrid second half with no further change in the score. This time, however, there was to be no repeat. Newmarket, to their credit, had decided on a bold and positive strategy rather than just sitting back and trying to minimise the damage. The game remained more closely contested than the scoreline would have suggested and Newmarket were rewarded with their best chances so far, a run into the D from the right touchline leading to a short corner from which a lifted shot sailed over Steve's goal.
The next goal, when it came though, was for the home team. Relishing his return to action, John notched up his second goal as he again showed his predatory instinct at close range. Playing his first game on the right wing, Laurie Haslop was proving his claim that right back really wasn't his position and he was much better up front. Too true! His pace and skills were leaving Newmarket with twisted blood and making a good case for dislodging Matt's earlier claim to the MoM title. His reward was South's final goal and his first for the club. How are we going to get him back in defence now?
With a few minutes left on the clock, an earlier warning from the umpires about wild tackling following a green card resulted in a yellow for Newmarket as one of their players bundled over Laurie in the D. After having the meaning of the card explained to him - this isn't football, you don't stay on the pitch - the player headed for the sin bin. As the clock wound down, there was still time for Newmarket to mount their most effective attack of the game, finally drawing a save from Steve for his first touch in two games that day! South saw off the threat to seal what must be South 3s's best performance and victory of the season.
With the other promotion-chasing side, St Neots 4s, drawing a staggering 7-7 with Bourne Deeping (were there no defenders on the pitch?), South remain two points off the top but with two games in hand. A tense run-in beckons.

South started very brightly and had several clear opportunities but were let down by a lack of composure in the D and a lack of luck at times. It looked like going right through to half-time goal less, but a penalty corner to March was awarded on the stroke of halftime. Somehow a fiercely struck shot heading well wide of the post was diverted back into the danger area and dispatched into the roof of the net before the South defence could react.
Second half and more of the same. A lot of South pressure came to nothing and March collected two more goals off of short corners. Despite this, heads never dropped and the last 15 minutes of the match were played out camped in March's half and yet despite everyone's best efforts the ball never managed to find its way the right side of the sticks. All in all a good performance and one that deserved a lot more than we got.

South were up against a team with a formidable record: undefeated on the pitch since the opening weekend of the season and 2-0 victors in the reverse fixture at The Leys in November. For pride as well as promotion prospects, this was a match South had to win.
While not quite inundated with the 20-player avalanche who had declared themselves available the previous weekend, South still had an impressive roster of 17 players to choose from. Or they did until Wednesday, after which numbers began to whittle away alarmingly: first captain Jelley aggravated a knee injury at pay-and-play to rule himself doubtful; then Andrew Fraser and Olly Lamming were surrendered to a short-handed 4s side; next Nick Venner, up in Nottingham for his sister's graduation party on Friday night, decided to take the free pass he was offered and skip a hungover early drive home; and finally Tom South awoke on Saturday with an asthma attack that left him with the peak flow capacity of an elderly tortoise with a 60-a-day habit. So it was that South arrived at St Neots with one fit substitute and a captain with a gammy knee.
Undaunted, South were quickly into their stride and competing well across the pitch. As expected, St Neots were savvy and difficult opponents, giving very little away and always with the capability to exploit any opening. The South defence, again featuring Paul South at centre back but with Jan Brynjolffssen restored to his old right back berth and Neil Sneade filling in at left back, were holding firm and clear chances for either side were thin on the ground. The breakthrough came from the visitors though, a well-worked short corner routine resulting in Stu Creed sweeping the ball past the St Neots keeper.
At half time the game remained tight with everything still to play for. With St Neots's well-known prowess at set pieces - over twenty goals from short corners alone this season, including nineteen from a single player - South were focusing on defending high and avoiding conceding fouls in the D. The midfield of Tristen Knight, Ali Edge, Stu and Tim Clapp, prominent in his resplendent yellow socks, were doing an excellent job of holding the line and the forwards were harrying the St Neots defence. Laurie Haslop in particular was again causing all sorts of problems with his nimble, pacy runs. By and large, the tactic was working with South keeper Chris Collinson rarely called on, although there were a couple of slight alarms when twice deep balls from St Neots seemingly headed off the back line rebounded off the posts to require hasty clearances.
Clear green water was finally found when another mazy run from Laurie drew a foul in the D. From the resulting short, strikes were twice saved before John Greaves got his statutory goal-a-game (now written into league bylaws, we believe) with a typical close-range poach.
There was no chance to relax though as St Neots regrouped and came again. Their set-piece strength paid off when a quickly taken hit from the dashed line outside the D was switched to the left for a well-taken deflected goal that looped up and beyond Chris into the corner of the South net. South weathered the storm and restored their two goal margin from yet another short corner routine. Again, the first strike was saved but on this occasion the ball dropped to South receiver Jan, who calmly pushed the ball straight between the goalkeeper's legs to roll over the line.
The game was still far from over though. St Neots hauled the margin back to one goal with a smooth short corner, slipped right past the runners before a clean strike inside the left post. Keeper Chris was also called on to earn his corn, a series of fantastic saves with pads and gloves keeping a pressing St Neots attack from finding the goal while doing a passable impression of River Dance. His grateful teammates even consented to overlook his pink neon shoes in the post-match lemon voting.
At the final whistle, a tired but happy South had inflicted St Neots 4s first home defeat of the season. Curiously, all five goals had originated from set plays! Both pre-Christmas losses having now been overturned, the team enters the home straight of the season looking to maintain its run of form.

With Ely lying second-bottom in the table South were the favoured side but as we reach the squeaky-bum stage of the season the home team knew nothing could be taken for granted.
The first period of play was a slow-burn opening for South, who were concerned to establish a solid platform before pushing forward to put pressure on the Ely goal. South were competing well in midfield, with Matt Kern back to lend his usual composed assurance and Laurie Haslop and Tom South adding attacking verve going forward. Clear goalscoring chances were slow in coming early on but the pressure was mostly on Ely while the South defence, including John Benedikz making a welcome return to league action, remained relatively composed.
As the second quarter approached, South gradually turned the screw and chances began to appear. A surging attack into the Ely D brought up the first goal when David Doup got his shot away and past the keeper. Ely continued to compete tenaciously and Neil Sneade had to be alert to block a hard-struck cross from South's right byline. Unfortunately, he blocked the slightly-rising ball with his ankle and promptly collapsed to the ground, eventually hobbling off with a badly bruised and slightly bloodied foot. Within minutes though, South had extended their lead courtesy of a beautifully flicked shot from Rupert Espley, placing the ball superbly beyond the keeper and dead centre into the open area of the goal. It remained 2-0 at half time, a solid if not commanding lead.
Coming out for the second period, South resumed their pressing play, confident more goals would follow. Indeed it proved, with first Tom and then Rupert again getting on the scoresheet to lend the scoreline an assured look. With the pressure of obtaining the result off, South relaxed and began to play some of their best hockey. Ely, having worked hard to compete with South for the first 40 minutes, were fading as the score tilted against them. Laurie's pacy dribbling was repeatedly opening up the opposition as holes appeared in their midfield, while Paul South and Matt were looking assured down the centre of the pitch.
South added further gloss to the scoreline when Neil, feeling having returned to his ankle, from right back anticipated an Ely pass and stepped in to intercept the ball, carrying it forward through the hole left in midfield before spying Goal-a-Game standing unmarked on the top of the D. The through ball found its target and Goal took a touch to bring the ball out from under his feet before hitting a clean strike low across the keeper to nestle in the far corner of the goal with a resounding thud.
The force was now firmly with South. Entering the final ten minutes, David matched Rupert's brace when picking up a rebound from Goal-a-Game to bring up the half-dozen. Unfortunately, this seemed to encourage South to get the metaphorical cigars out. The collective foot came off the gas and, with time ticking down to the final few minutes, Ely were allowed to run through at South's defence. Jan Brynjolffssen then made his late bid for the Lemon vote: as the covering defender he was comfortably on to a ball played through into the South D, collecting it before executing a superb lay off straight into the path of the oncoming Ely forward who gratefully finished with panache, putting a firm strike between Chris Collinson and his post. So the clean sheet was conceded but the result keeps South on course for their title challenge and promotion.","Men's 3rds beat Ely City 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

St Catz, in a derby against Cambridge City M4s. Despite the last-minute drop-out of their captain (paying the price for doubling up the previous week with an injury), the visitors brought a strong team and were anticipating a good fight for first points. It was City, however, that got out of the blocks best: a simple movement down their right flank and a run to the far post saw keeper Shahbaz Ali powerless to avoid an early set-back for the visitors.
Quick thinking on the sideline prompted a change of plan, dropping the team back to a more comfortable 4-4-2 formation. With the central duo of Bhav Virdi and Colin Troll stamping their authority on the pitch, South started to press City more. Soon enough, the pressure resulted in a short corner, slickly dispatched with the good ol Chris Graveling special. South were back in the game. In fact, one might be excused to say that South were the better side. The next 15-odd minutes saw play mostly consigned to the home half, where the South attack was ably supported by flying wingbacks Ian Glover and Tom Anns. It was quite against the run of play when City managed to break out and convert a short corner into a 2-1 lead at half-time...
At this point, the team wasnt feeling too bad, even though they were behind. They rightly felt things were coming together and City was being contained. All that was needed, was composure on the ball and tenacity, and the goals would surely come. But it was not to be. The second half saw the midfield disintegrating (not helped, undoubtedly, by the unseasonably warm September sunshine). Despite valiant efforts by Chris Walsh, distributing the ball beautifully, and Tim Clapp, making himself available at all times, both sides slid down into a game of long balls and isolated attacks. Citys large complement of subs began to tell, as did their skilful centre forward: it was the home side that got most of the chances to increase the score line; luck more than skill kept the deficit to a single goal. For all their hard work, South couldnt find their way into the opposition D and the game ended with the score line unchanged.
Reflecting on the game gave a mixture of frustration and relief. The team clearly has enough ability to beat a side like City, as shown in the second part of the first half. But yet again, the lack of fitness and cohesion as a team made itself felt. At the same time, we were lucky not to concede more goals and start the season even lower on the league table. Once again, there were spells of promising play and nobody could fault the teams commitment, but hard work will be needed by all to improve our performance in upcoming games.","Men's 2nds lose to Cambridge City 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

South had put their various social plans on hold, with key members of the squad travelling home from Norwich and even Cornwall (but not Spain?) for this critical opening encounter.  Captain McCulloch stressed the need from the off for South to be focused, intelligent, and first to the 50-50 balls.
However, for the first ten minutes it was South who still seemed to be on holiday with Ely winning a series of short corners from some suspect South defending.   Fortunately these were dealt with by the disciplinarian himself, George Ledley King Wych.
As the half progressed it was South who took the game to their opponents, with their performance ironically befitting of the famous albescent sporting colour their opponents were wearing.   Wheels (Russell) was beginning to gas his marker, and it was no surprise when he raced on to a slipped through ball from Matt Emanuel Adebayor Readman to speed away from his marker and slip the ball under the keepers dive for one nil.
The goal relaxed South, who grew in confidence as the half wore on.   Two quick goals from Graham Roman Pavlyuchenko McCulloch and the midfield maestro Jack Luka Modric Chalk saw that South took a deserving 3-0 lead in at half time.
The message from el capitain was for more of the same- and South duly obliged.   Further pressure lead to an early short corner; with the unscripted move of pass to stopper/stopper nail it in the bottom right being performed to perfection for Luka to get his second.   Rich Gareth Bale Claes soon pitched up with another from a quite mazy run, very much reminiscent of an October night in Milan, as he bamboozled past numerous defenders before slamming the ball into the far corner from the left.
There was still time for two more goals- one, an excellent finish from the top of the D by Luka to earn himself the match ball and a jug (its amazing he still had money left over for his match fees), as well as a thunderbolt from John Tom Huddlestone Hawkes which left the keeper with no hope.  Special mention must go to keeper Steve Brad Friedel Parker for an excellent save late on to ensure the proverbial icing very much stayed on the South cake.  Unfortunately, there was a late yellow card for Tom Watson for a couple of over-enthusiastic stick tackles which earnt him the lemon award in the absence of any real comedy gaffes from the remainder of the team.
All in all, an excellent performance, somewhat resplendent of last Sunday lunchtime in North London.  South will run into tougher matches over the remainder of the season, no more so than next weekend at promotion favorites Bourne Deeping, but performances like this will mean they will be right in the promotion shake-up at the end of the season.

Although St Neots did show some good play as a team, all their threats were quickly and effectively snuffed out by a solid defense. 
Special mention should be made of Dave Monck and Tom Watson who strengthened the team: one giving up a jaunt to Bourne Deeping for it; the other disregarding his own later game in support of our defense.

In the early stages, South matched their opposition, with a combination of a solid disciplined midfield and some excellent last ditch tackling from Wych seeing off their opponents.   When South went forward themselves they too looked dangerous, with McCulloch Johnson and Claes combining on one earfly occasion to test the Bourne keeper.

However, Bourne Deeping were having the lions share of possession, and were clearly very comfortable playing a quick slick-moving game.   The game turned midway through the half, when, following the snuffing out of a South short, the oppositions rapid one touch passing soon saw them in the South D, and the forward calmly lifted the ball over Parker for one nil.

Unperturbed, South looked to respond, and were in the middle of a strong attack, when Aston, seeking to spread the play, played the ultimate anti Modric pass across the centre line to the Bourne centre mid.   Bourne promptly rushed forward and slotted home for two nil.   A hammer blow.

At half time, the focus was on keeping pride and looking to push forward wherever possible in search of something from the game.  South played a solid enough second half, with some enterprising attacking play being coupled with some great saves at the back from Parker, but in truth it was no surprise when another free-flowing Bourne move led to the right winger deflecting home a cross for three nil.

South will play worse matches this season and come out comfortable winners, but for them to challenge for promotion this year it will be crucial they have a full compliment of players for the crunch games, and also that they look to emulate what was some fine hockey from their opponents.

Everyone arrived on time as no one could bear another minute watching the England rugby lads crash out of the world cup. 
In the time prior to the game the captain chose to put his team members' heads into a spin forcing the dizzy drill that is the pepper pot on them while Shahbaz sat bored stiff in the back of his goal, a position he would spend the rest of his morning.
St Ives appeared to turn up with 12 men and an umpire. For the first 15 minutes of the game South were dominant. Russell Johnson started off the scoring for the second week in a row. Maybe that was because he is (Wheels) the quickest runner in the team. South were in fine form and there was a smile on everyones face as we proceeded to stick goal after goal passed the oppo. Crisp passing, quick feet, strength, girlfriends and good looks were all things South were demonstrating in abundance. 
The conversion of possession into goals was satisfying for all to watch. In this first period of the game the defence had to maintina their concentration as the game was mostly played ahead of them, It clearly wasnt the game St Ives had been planning as they set out their team in the morning. It is not often a team concedes this many goals in quick succession but if you have ever been there to witness it you will know the stages the team goes through:
<ul><li>After the first goal there is shock and cries of disbelief and the captain will shout some encouragement.</li><li>Then when the second goal goes in the wind is knocked from their sails.</li><li>After the 3rd goal the team resigns to the fact they are going to lose and they put up camp in their own half.</li><li>When picking the ball out of the back of the net for the fourth time, it might seem easiest to give the ball straight back to the opponents from push back. </li><li>After five goals in 25 minutes the team begins to shout at everyone and anyone who will listen to them such as umpires and team mates.</li></ul>
However, to their immense credit St Ives did step their game up with a few minutes to spare in the first half and were awarded a number of short corners in a row. South allowed their alertness to drop before one such short and in that moment St Ives took their opportunity to pull one back.
Half time team talk was a strange affair. clearly the captain was not satisfied with a 4 goal lead. After our ticking off we headed back to the goal fest. 
The goals didnt come easily in the second period but just like buses when one comes there is sure to be another straight after. Thats exactly what happened when about 15 minutes in John H found the ball on his reverse and to everyones disbelief he pulled off what is currently the strike of the season thumping the backboard. 
The rest of the goals are a blur in my mind; I know one thing though, we held a clean sheet in the second half and Shahbaz didnt feature. The last two goals I do remember as quite impressive a lot of passing followed by a Captain's tap in.
So all in all a convincing 9-1 win was dispatched. What has been said to be one of the 1st team's largest ever deficit in this league according to Jack's records. Well if you trust him with his facts youll already have him in your fantasy team because theres no disputing hell have goal king rapped up by Christmas at his going rate.

Spalding is a fair old distance to travel, particularly to a team that won 7-0 to a team the 2s could only muster a 0-0 draw against. The first 15 minutes, south's hockey was bright and sharp, and they were unlucky not to take the lead when Troll's shot was cleared from the line. Gradually Spalding seemed to warm up, playing good pass and move hockey, leading to 2 goals, both from shorts. the first was a neatly played mutliple pass for an easy finish, with the second a straightforward strike to the bottom left corner, where  Monck failed to keep it out.
Perhaps because the 2s expected to be totally dominated, 2-0 felt very much like we were still in it, and several good opportunities in the first half gave confidence for the second. And South struck first after the break, with a move planned in the car on the way up. Monck creamed the ball into the D, for Barton to deflect home, 2-1. Spalding were often quick on the break, and although the defensive unit made life hard for them, eventually they were overwhelmed by sheer numbers of attackers, and Spalding restored their 2 goal advantage. But the cushioned was soon halved, as South won a short, which Monck duly dispatched to the bottom right corner. 3-2 and game on.
Spalding's 4th goal was not one of the defensive unit's finest moments. Ali played a short pass to Passmore, who's mind seemed to be elsewhere. With a centre forward pressuring, he could only push the ball towards the back line. Monck, carefully watching the ball go out, allowed another attacker to take the ball off the line, bring it front of goal and finish adeptly. Spalding and their significant crowd, delighted by the debacle giving them back a two goal lead.
But despite this, South seemed the more dangerous, both in trying to score goals and in hacking down the opposition. Espley was duly yellow carded for an axe like hack, following on from several poor quality tackles that could easily have ended up with the same consequence. With a man down, South conceded another short, which headed towards the bottom left corner, similar to their second goal. But this time, Monck, bravely, didn't have anough time to move his leg out the way, and did a poor job of hiding the limp from the shot. Penalty flick for 5-2 and curtains on the game. Up stepped the mighty Ali, and redeemed himself for his earlier mistake, and saved a pretty poor qaulity flick. But a saved flick is a saved flick - credit to the keeper.
With Espley back on, south then created the move of the match, driving down the left, creating space for Barton to go one on one with the keeper. Rounding him to the left, Barton finished off with his first reverse stick goal of the season, and gave South hope of securing a point. Press as they might, a fourth goal didn't come. But despite losing, there was a deep sense of satisfaction throughout the team. It had been a team performance reminicent of the quality that had one them promotion and 11 straight wins against a quality opposition. 
Tired, satisfied from a good allbeit losing hockey match, and smelly from the Spalding failure to provide showers, teas were held in a luxury pub with generous sofas, where Monck was awarded Man of the match as part of an excellent defensive unit, and Anns picked up the coveted Lemon for being captain for the day.","Men's 2nds lose a good game against Spalding 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Spalding came closest to scoring in the opening exchanges. A quick break coupled with slick passing created a sharp chance for a man unmarked beyond the left-hand post. Fortunately for South he could only hit the side netting with the goal at his mercy. This served as a wake-up call and, after some surprising angry shouts at each other, South started to get a grip on the game. 
Bhavdeep Virdi, John Hawkes and Mark Williams began breaking up neat Spalding triangles, relieving the pressure. The deadlock was finally broken midway through the first half. Noticing that the Spalding defence was high, Tom Watson slipped the ball into the space behind for Russell Johnson to run onto. Out-pacing the recovering defenders, Russell flicked the ball passed the keepers left foot. 
This set back only seemed to spur Spalding on. Souths tackling became more desperate as Spalding pressed harder seeking an equaliser. After the match Jack Chalk owned up to being one member of a 4 man stick-tacking effort! (I think you mean well timed and clean tacking - Ed.) With the pressure building a Spalding equaliser might have been deserved. In fact it seemed inevitable when Spalding finally managed to flick a shot passed Steve Parker - only to see Finn Johnson nonchalantly pluck the ball out of the air and clear to safety. The pressure and tense atmosphere clearly started to get to South with more bitter words exchanged between South players as the home side struggled to preserve their lead.
After the interval, South reorganised with Chris Graveling bringing experience and a calming influence to Souths play. The defence of George Wych, Dave Aston, Eliot Read and Finn Johnson was seeming more secure allowing South s midfield to press forward. On the right Jack combined well Souths forwards and, on his South debut, Tom Howell was linking well with Souths regulars. 
South started to take a grip on the match as the half wore on. Tom Watson was unlucky not to increase the lead after a quick hit outside the D finished with Toms deflected shot looping into the goal - milliseconds after the umpires whistle was blown. This only seemed to spur Jon on. He opened up his box of tricks to produce a glorious ariel to release Graham McCulloch, a move that could have put South further ahead. Next out of Jons box was the reverse stick shot from the top of the D which cannoned into the backboard.  2-0! Not to be outdone Graham latched onto a probing pass, ghosted passed his marker, and sweetly nestled his shot inside the left hand post. With the points secure South rode out the last couple of minutes without drama. 
After the match Souths Captain applauded the teams commitment and passing which was visibly shaper then recent games. 
A special thank you to all those that gave up their Saturday afternoon to support us for this vital game. It was really appreciated!

After taking a few minutes to settle in, South began to grow in confidence and used their usual outlets to threaten the Wisbech back line. Speedy wingers Russell Johnson and Rich Claes looked dangerous and when midfielders Virdi, Williams and Chalk were able to get the ball out to them South looked like a useful team. Not surprisingly it was one such fast breakaway that opened the scoring. Coming off his wing, Johnson outpaced the back four with ease to latch on to a perfect through ball down the middle and he touched the ball neatly past the keeper. Shortly afterwards South doubled their lead after some good work down the right by Finn Johnson. The ball was delivered into the D at speed and after only being on the pitch for a few moments, debutant Chris Pearson opened his South account with a nicely taken finish. A two goal cushion was enough to really settle the team down and the standard of play was improved accordingly. With Chris Graveling and the returning Nick Bristowe providing some additional composure and experience at the back, South rarely looked likely to concede. However, a few man marking issues caused the occasional nervous moment as Wisbech snuck past Souths midfield all too easily on the break.
Before halftime South bagged a third, Chalk made a strong run through midfield and showed good composure to get his head up and pick out Souths centre forwards run across the goal. Jon Hawkes touch was delicate but just enough to nudge the ball into the bottom corner.
A three goal lead was a decent return at the interval but Souths players were honest enough to admit that their performance as a group hadnt reached the level that the team expects of itself. With this in mind South restarted the game seeking to use the ball better and improve the accuracy and speed of their passing. When the team were able to link up well they looked very dangerous and after one particularly good move down the left, Jack Chalk found his way into the D with the ball and, despite having teammates in good positions, Chalk chose to shoot and his firm flick found the backboard with ease. During the rest of the half South were largely kept at bay by Wisbech who, to their credit, didnt bat an eyelid at being 4-0 down and kept trying to play positive hockey throughout the game. South failed to excel for much of the second half, with the only significant highlight being Russell Johnsons excellent second goal. After saving an initial shot the keeper found himself on the deck with Johnson looming over him with the ball on his stick. Rather than simply lifting the ball over him, Johnson casually moved the ball away from goal and spanked it as hard as he could into the roof of the net; confident, stylish and the games best moment!
South failed to add to their lead and at the death Wisbech scored from a short corner; frustrating for South but probably a fair reward for the home teams efforts.
All in all it was a good professional result for South who kept their league campaign well on track without setting the world alight. Tougher tests will surely come later in the season and when they do South will need to move the ball better to get the same success.","Men's 1sts beat Wisbech Town 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Rutland started in confident form, moving the ball around and having the lion's share of possession for the first quarter. Solid defence from the familiar-looking Aston /  Bristowe / Wych / Graveling / Read back line snuffed out most of the attacks and when Rutland did get through and force a short corner, Parker was equal to it and made a fantastic diving save low down to his right. 

Eliot was also in fine form, making several superb interceptions and slowly the tide turned with South being able to put some sustained pressure on the Rutland goal. Both Mark Williams and Graham McCulloch had shots saved before a good move involving John Hawkes, Rich Claes and Russell Johnson led to the ball falling to Jack Chalk just a few feet outside the left hand side of the goal. Chalk is in such a rich vein of scoring this season that the result was never in doubt - one nil to South.

In the second half South played much better and had a number of chances before Dave Aston, playing a neat one-two with John on the edge of the D, forced his way into the area and fired an unstoppable rocket through a defender and past the despairing outstretched leg of the keeper. Fantastic goal .......... or at least that's how Dave described it to his girlfriend, but what really happened was this: the ball bounced off John's stick and fell to Dave just inside the area. Dave then scuffed a cross which dribbled slowly towards the goal. The keeper, thinking that the ""shot"" had been taken outside the area called ""Leave It!"" to the defender who duly did so and the keeper himself lifted his foot to let the ball into the goal where it came to rest just over the line but before hitting the backboard. Dave then let out a cry like a man passing a kidney stone and sprinted back to celebrate with his fellow defenders. Jammy goal maybe but a goal nonetheless; South had a precious 2 goal cushion and the spectators had something to recount to their grandchildren - an Aston goal.

The rest of the game was played out with a sense of unreality - had Dave Aston really scored a goal? Surely not, but the scoreline couldn't lie could it? Some time in the last 15 minutes John Hawkes made it 3-0 with a goal that I think might have been a great strike from the edge of the area, perhaps it was taken on the reverse, but to be honest that Aston goal really left me stunned so I remember very little about what happened, or indeed how I got home after the match.

I do, however, have a general recollection that it was a scrappy game in which South confirmed their title aspirations by playing poorly but still coming away with 3 points.","Men's 1sts beat Rutland 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

And as we all know, that just unsettles the natural order of things. And the natural order of things this season centres around South 1s winning. So with South missing a couple of key defenders this week (and Bristowe...), perhaps a crucial derby match against the ever-amicable City boys was not the best time to try out our new ambitious 1-6-3 formation.
Its hard to explain our reckless start to the match. Personally I think it had something to do with the widespread shock caused by Readman's unprecedented appearance at the pitch a whole 30 minutes before the push-back. Whatever the reasons, South found themselves immediately on the back foot, regularly scampering back as wave after wave of City attacks rattled everyone. And then City scored. Against the meanest defence in the league! This wasn't in the script. Something must be done. Unfortunately, 'something' turned out to be conceeding another goal. 2-0 down in the first 15 minutes and South were clearly shaken. It was all rather reminiscent of England vs Germany in the last World Cup. Meanwhile City were running rampant, audaciously throwing aerials down the lines at every opportunity and getting in behind our defence. 
But there were glimmers of hope. Hawkes and Claes were combining well on the left and Watson and Johnson (R) on the right. Not to be left out, Aston appeared to make several commendable attempts to combine with Howell, despite Howell being a sub, standing on the sidelines at the time. But going forward, the team were gelling well and controlling passages of play. 
Ironically, it was a defender (Johson (F)) joining in the attack that brought about South's first goal. A fizzing diagonal ball into the D was met by the lively Claes, who got the deftest of touches to beat the keeper and reassure South that they were still in the game. 
The defence were still pouring forward, much to Readman's alarm. After a quick tactical change-up at the back, Wych found himself in the unfamiliar territory of the right-back's position as South tried to tame City's troublesome winger. No sooner had he settled than he put in a brilliant interception to prevent what surely would have been another City goal. At least, that's how he described it. Others have suggested it was the most blatant high-stick stop in living memory. Needless to say, the yellow card came out and South were down to 10 men. 
A well-taken strike from a City short-corner piled even more problems on South. The whistle blew for half-time with South looking a bit shell-shocked. 'Glum' is the word that best summed up most people's expressions as the team gathered to plan a way out. The captain, ever the optimist (haha - banter) urged a spirited comeback and asked for 4 goals in the second half. All of a sudden, South started playing the assured hockey we know we can, bossing the midfield and making it difficult for any City player on the ball. 
The forwards were linking well and when a ball was slipped right to McCulloch in the D, he didn't need a second invitation, lashing the ball into the far corner. 3-2 and it had just got tasty! As South's spirits rose, City (yes - you know what's coming) started to unravel. Another swift attack up the right saw McCulloch beat his man, draw another defender and square the ball to Johnson (R) who took the ball in his stride (as he had all game) and calmly slotted it past the onrushing keeper to level the score at 3-3. Time was running out for South as they searched for another goal. City were feeling the pressure too and astonishingly managed to turn an attacking free hit in South's 22 into a reversed decision and a yellow card for one of their players. 
Seizing the initiative, South moved the ball wide and up the left to Watson who used some fancy stick-work (precocious teenagers, eh?) to beat most of the defence on his way to the byline before pulling it back for Chalk to flick it past the keeper and send the watching crowds into a frenzy of jubilation. Or something like that. A few minutes later the final whistle blew, confirming South's gritty come-back. Ahhh - its almost more satisfying to win a derby when you first let the opposition convince themselves they're going to pull off an upset and then you (pardon the expression) urinate on their fire and steal the points right at the end. Thanks to all the team for a determined team performance in the second half and to the spectators who braved the cold to watch.","Men's 1sts beat local rivals Cambridge City 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Aware that this would be a hard game, South turned up early to get proper warm-up, while the opposition confused everyone by playing rugby alongside us. Empirical evidence, however, suggests that the home side won the preparation war: although Bourne Deeping had most of both ball and territory in the first half, they found it all but impossible to penetrate the home D and create some chances, let alone really trouble keeper Shahbaz. 
Showing their mettle, though, the visitors kept their heads cool and chipped away at the home defence. Eventually - and somewhat inevitably - they did get through, quite possibly with a reverse stick hit. Adding insult to injury, it took little more than minutes for a second goal to fall, giving Bourne Deeping a more comfortable two-goal lead. Home fears that wed broken the seal proved unfounded and the half finished in the same vein as it began.
South came out in the second, determined to keep the score line down and start working their way forward. Unfortunately, nobody had informed Bourne Deeping of this and they insisted on playing their own game and getting a third goal in. At 3-0 up, the visitors may have thought the game was safe and slowed down; South, however, begged to differ and went into the attack. A beautiful pass through the defence saw Ali Edge alone in the Bourne D. Disdaining the traditional route of controlling the ball, Ali simply jabbed it past the strangely wide-footed goalie to score our first goal in four games. Just to show this wasnt a complete freak occurrence, Ali bagged himself another goal within minutes, when Souths first (and last) short was expertly fluffed by both sides, leaving the ball exposed (and quickly dispatched of) at the far post.
At 2-3 down, all of sudden South seemed back in the game. But then Lady Luck decided to switch sides: a high ball in the South D was worked into the goal with an overarm smash that Andy Murray would be proud of. Dissent from three playing umpires notwithstanding, the two with whistles decided there was nothing wrong with this blatantly illegal goal and let it stand. After the game, the rulebook confirmed that complaints were well-founded, but the damage was already done, a cushion for the visitors reinstated and our momentum checked.
So did that break Souths spirit? Did it hell! Before Bourne Deeping had finished marvelling at their slice of luck, the home side presented itself in the opposition D again. A well-worked long corner saw Dom Nelson cunningly aim to hit the far post, yet deliver the ball to the near one, where Ali Edge was yet again on station to deflect the ball. Mindful of Doms original plan, Ali put the ball half an inch outside the far post, with Ally Ward glumly realising a headlong dive wouldve secured the goal.
This proved to be the last fluttering of Souths comeback. Soon, Bourne Deeping reinstated the three-goal lead, when their attacker snuck behind Ron Orens back to deflect a cross past an understandably powerless Shahbaz. In the dying moments of the match, the visitors got a sixth goal in some fashion or other; but it was all academic by then.
Reflecting on the game, South felt suitably proud of themselves. Belying the gap in league positions, they gave Bourne Deeping as good as they got, rattling and almost overturning the visitors. Notwithstanding the controversial goal, Bourne Deeping probably deserved to win, but South showed their capacity to play way above their present, lowly state in the league. With a few softer games coming up, its essential to keep this form and fighting spirit up and start putting some points on the board.","Men's 2nds lose to Bourne Deeping 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Captain McCulloch showed a superb turn of pace to catch the grounds man just before he left the car park and then used his leadership skills to talk him into sacrificing another two hours of his evening for the team.
With the lights back on, South showed their professionalism by emerging from the darkness in fine form and dominating the opening exchanges. Playing at Wilberforce road as the sun went down gave the match a distinctly summer hockey feel and South players were enjoying themselves accordingly. The midfield held firm defensively and moved the ball swiftly and sensibly once possession had been won. At the back, South looked completely in control throughout the first half with last weeks lapses in concentration a distant memory. Wing backs Eliot Read and Man of the Match, Chris Graveling in particular managed to dominate their opponents and still find time to make a significant contribution going forwards. With plenty of service to feed on, Souths 3 starting forwards saw lots of the ball, with Rich Claes on the left making numerous penetrating runs and McCulloch and Russell Johnson causing a sense of trepidation in the oppositions defenders and they jinked and swerved past them.
Despite a decent start, South didnt create a definite chance until the first planned substitutions were made, Chris Pearson getting off a snap shot with his first touch. This proved to be the catalyst for a purple patch for South in which they won a succession of short corners. Noticing a significant space on one side of the D, South chose to exploit the perceived weakness, Graveling nearly broke the deadlock on two occasions before Mark Williams finally gave South the lead they had deserved with a trademark firm push that caressed a defenders stick en-route to finding the backboard between the keepers ankles.
The last few minutes of the half descended into an unsightly shouting match between some of the St Neots players and one or two equally fired up South players. The banter was fairly unimaginative and all players involved should probably work on their material before the return fixture.
The half time break gave South a chance to regroup and calm things down, generally they had been playing well but 1-0 is such a precarious score line the next 35 minutes could easily have turned sour had South not come out as focused as they did. The general theme of the second half involved South defending solidly and passing the ball well but somehow failing to really test the St Neots keeper. The fate of the game rested on the next goal and before South managed to snuffle it, there were one or two scary moments as St Neots pushed forwards. Steve Parker showed his class by making a couple of smart saves and tidying up a few loose balls in the D, despite having had little to do for much of the game. St Neots also had a few short corners that could have caused problems had Bristowe and Wych not closed down so efficiently. When South did manage to double their lead it was a scruffy affair from a misworked short corner. The keeper saved the initial shot and was pounced on by the ever industrious Pearson who managed to prod the ball out from underneath the keepers pads and over the line. From that moment on, the game was won and South were able to play with more confidence. Chalk, Virdi and the excellent Tom Watson bossed the midfield as St Neots tired, and the final 10 minutes were played exclusively in the visitors half. Chances came thick and fast from all areas of the pitch but it took a well-planned short corner routine to extend Souths Advantage. Graham McCulloch got on the end of a perfect pass to deflect the ball into the bottom corner. The same player scored again minutes later to hot up the race for this seasons golden stick, this time getting on the end of the best move of the game to nudge the ball in from close range.
It was another hard earned 3 points for South, making it an impressive 7 wins out of 8. There is a long way to go but, putting teams like St Neots away by a few goals shows the progress the team has made since last season where points were dropped unnecessarily against such sides. South are also showing the right attitude and working hard for one another which will serve them well as they approach the vital Christmas period!","Men's 1sts beat St Neots 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

True to recent form, South arrived at the pitch nice and early, greeted by a strangely empty astro for a midday game. Never ones to complain, the team proceeded to chuck aerials around the pitch, claiming it as a proper warm-up.
Whatever the warm-up, it seemed to work as the visitors were clearly faster out of the blocks than the home side. Within minutes of the starting whistle, South had won a short corner; slickly counting on the defenders inability to clear Tom Howells cannonball, injector Dom Nelson guided the ball over the line to give South an early lead. This only served to wake up St Ives, though, who came back at the visitors strongly; capitalising on Souths defence being in array more than organised, the home side used a quickly taken free hit to wander into the D and slot an equaliser past keeper Shahbaz for yards out.
All square at half-time, South decided to strengthen their midfield and pledged to start marking properly. For a while, this resolve paid off, with the visitors the more dangerous team in the early second half. But then St Ives won a short, worked the ball to the far post and took the lead. Tabled turned, it was South that was fired up now, making numerous forays into opposition territory. Chances were created left, right and centre and in the end it was Dom again who put his name on the score sheet, lifting the ball over a prostrate keeper from all of a yard out.
With about 15 minutes to go and the game was open to all takers, it was again South that was pressing harder. One could claim that luck - once again - was not with the visitors: several chances went narrowly wide of the mark, while most lookers-on wouldve agreed that South shouldve been awarded a few shorts (especially when a rampant Nick Venner got upended in the sort of tackle that even rugby referees disagree with). All attempts notwithstanding, the game ended in a rather disappointing draw.

However, there were moments of class - in particular Steve Parker pulling off one of the saves of the season to ensure South 1sts  kept another clean sheet - their 5th of the league campaign so far. But for the most part, South 2s did just enough to cause the 1s juggernaut to falter at the vital point of each attack. 
Following the earnest instructions of the captain not to be complacent against their lower-placed rivals, the 1s showed excellent sharpness in the first half, consistently dispossessing their opposite number and intercepting any stray passes. Williams, Chalk, Hawkes and Watson in midfield moved the ball swiftly to the forwards who were exchanging passes nicely and threatening the opposition's D nearly every minute. Many of these attacks resulted in short-corners and this was where the 1s uncharacteristically struggled. Bereft of the element of surprise, new routines were hastily devised and a number of chance went begging in front of the stubborn pads of Shahbaz in the 2s goal. Finally a short corner was bundled in by the persistent Pearson. Note-ably another goal scored whilst captain and vice-captain stood on the sidelines. Coincidence...?
Following one goal-mouth scramble set up by the terrier-like Johnson (R), a penalty flick was awarded to the 1s. Now, I can't be certain but I think what happened next was that Chalk, filled with sympathy for the luck-less 2s defence, graciously missed the penalty on purpose. Yes - that must be the explanation. Not content with just one display of generosity, the gallant Chalk started clearing the 1s attacking short-corners for the opposition, almost lifting one 'drag-flick' (and I use the term loosely) over the high fence behind goal. A convincing LOM performance and it wasn't even half-time!
The second half saw South 2s fighting back with renewed confidence and imagination. More chances were missed by the 1s as the game stretched with neither side content with a 1-0 scoreline. In the end it was the 1s who found the back of the goal, with Watson latching onto a lifted pull-back from the right-hand side by-line and scoring an excellent volley apparently with his hand (still holding the stick). It was a cruel blow for the 2s but they continued to pile on the pressure and the last 10 minutes saw numerous chances for a come-back goal. But, fortunately for the 1s, none were forthcoming and the final whistle brought to an end an entertaining, albeit less-than-convincing, win for the 1s.   
With 8 wins out of 9 and another draw for their closest rivals, South 1s move to 2nd in the league with the best defensive record to boot. Well done to all the squad for the determined performance this week and a consistently good turn-out to training. Lets keep this winning streak going!

The two sides showed a striking difference in preparation for the game: where the away side (a/k/a 1s) arrived impressively early and had a team talk the size of the Titanic, the 2s leisurely rocked up, dinked a few balls around and were marshalled into formation with a mere 15 minutes to go. Then again, the 2s game plan was beautiful in its simplicity: get in the 1s faces and annoy the hell out of em. Whatever could do wrong?
In keeping with recent form, the 2s came out storming. Valiantly ignoring the fact that the 1s have the better players, man for man, and are holding a position at the other end of the league, it was the 2s that pressed hardest in the first few minutes. Tight man-marking in the back and a hard-working four-man midfield snuffed out most of the attacks in yellow before they could trouble keeper Shahbaz. Then a lucky strike off a short corner trickled agonisingly over the line, giving the 1s a rather undeserved lead. Undue optimism by the opposition capn notwithstanding, 2s didnt drop their heads and fought on stubbornly, keeping everything tight and clean for half-time, despite a flurry of short corners at the end of the half. 
The second half was always going to be battle of wills. 2s felt that they had the 1s frustrated and struggling, but the 1s have a knack for coming back strong. Duly fired up by the skips request to take the fight to them, again it was 2s that started off better, made their way into the 1s D and notched up their own short corners. Slick moves in midfield and strong runs upfront belied the lowly league position of the team, showing all sorts of promise. But yet again, when a goal did come, it did against the run of play, falling to the 1s. 
As legs tired and lungs burned, play got stretched and more chances appeared on both sides. One might say that the single best chance fell to the 2s, with a rising shot from close range miraculously deflected by the cat-like reflexes of Steve Parker. But on the other side of the pitch, hard graft was needed to keep the score line reasonable until the final whistle.
Lost the game they might have, but the 2s stepped off the pitch holding their heads high. In a game against a side thats pushing for promotion, where the pre-match banter was always going against them, they didnt give any quarter, fought like lions for the full 70 minutes and showed that theyre better than their league positions suggests.

Wisbech is amusingly <a href=""http://www.wisbech-town.co.uk/"">described</a> as A fine, historical Georgian market town (established in 1996).
Arriving slightly too early to use the pitch was a good sign.  There was a general sense of preparedness and focus for the first time this season.  Once the pitch was available the team took to a good warm-up, clearly focussing on the task at hand.
Captain Ron Orens announcement that South will be lining-up with 4-4-2 was met with cheers of jubilation, mostly because this formation has proven itself as the best fit for the M2s on more than one occasion in recent times.
South started the game the more energised, testing the home sides defences a couple to times in the opening exchanges.  It was on eight minutes that one of these forays paid off:  Dom won the ball in midfield and squared left to Nick who made a penetrating run into the circle to earn a short corner.  Ron pushed the ball out for Colin to strike only for the skipper to touch an unstoppable deflection into the net.  One-nil South.  Game on!  Will that change everything now there is something to play for?
Traditionally taking the lead this season has meant uncertainty, nervousness and a deep, mousy retreat into the 25 metre area.  But this time was different.  Things were looking up and everyone was buoyed by the breakthrough.  Genuine belief that there was more gold in them there hills was clear for all to see.
South were using both flanks well to attack.  A good interchange between Tom and Ally - the Movember-moustached Mario Brothers of the side - saw a further threat up the left channel.  And then another clear chance, this time forged by Ron and Ian on the right, found Jimmy who squared for Rob for a tap-in in front of goal.  Unfortunately, the umpire had already blown for another short.
By this point the match had opened considerably and there was an ebb and flow to the contest.  Whilst South were looking the more ominous, Wisbech were finding a lot of space on their right side.
Half time.  The narrowest of leads and plenty of work still to do.
At the break, skipper Ron decided to rest the ever-ready Jimmy for a few minutes at the start of the second half.  A couple of frailties in the defensive tactics were also identified and looked to be closed.  But the general message was to keep going and keep believing.  Wise words.
With the second half underway, it was the hosts who took the game by the horns and managed to concentrate play in and around the visitors 25.  This was the toughest period of the game for South along with the biggest test for the back line.  Further up the field, Nick was involved in some mild argy-bargy with an opponent which could have seen them both green carded.  There were a few other bumps elsewhere - the match was becoming a physical affair.  
So it was somewhat against the run of play when Dom fired a low, cross-field strike to Ally at the back post.  Ally did everything right to deflect the ball into the goal with a low, reverse stick but somehow - implausibly - the Wisbech keeper managed to smother it.  Nonetheless, good play all round.
At the other end, the home side sensed that time was ticking away and pressed ever more liberally.  One of their strikes blazoned over the bar.  The others were resiliently foiled, mostly by brave challenges from Ian and Ron in particular.  In one tackle, Ian injured himself - taking a blow to that ankle again - and South were briefly down to ten men before Ally realised that he needed to get on the pitch.  (A lemon-worthy neglect in its own right, if it were not for Nicks fracas.)
With Colin, Tom and Andy too, the whole defence was still looking pretty impenetrable and safely mopping any leaks.  Indeed, goalkeeper Steve was well protected and saw little action.  The home side was getting very frustrated and at one point a player in red saw the red mist and was lucky not to get carded for dissent.
The last few embers of the game saw South keep possession of the ball well and even manage a last ditch attack from a free hit close to the D.  In the end, the travellers had done enough.  Time was up and South had held on for the first win of the 2011-12 campaign.  Finally!
The closing whistle was met with a sense of relief, and possibly a slight twist of disbelief.  This wasnt the best performance - and indeed the game could best be described as a mostly even yet scrappy affair - but realistically it has always been a matter of time before South reaped the rewards of their plenty-good-enough recent form to clinch all three points on a Saturday.
South can, and should, regain much confidence from this result.  After all, its a result which proves that they are playing well enough to win fixtures in this division.  Theres no reason why South cant get used to successful trends again if the current level of hockey is maintained, continuing next week when they host Rutland M2s at St Catz.

Jon Hawkes, ever an astute student of Sun Tsu, started Souths rolling midfield substitutions after 30 seconds so he could rearrange his protective shin-pads - a tactic that earned him several votes for Lemon.  With order restored South started to boss the midfield and control the game. The makeshift defence of George Wych, Chris Graveling, Finn Johnson and Jack Chalk filling in at right back was looking secure. Upfront an unfamiliar front line with 3 of 4 from Chris Pearson, Richard Claes, Tom Howell, Graham McCulloch was gelling nicely. 
With South in control it was no surprise when Graham McCullough opened the scoring with a goal that seemed eerily familiar. So familiar in fact that Ive just copied & pasted a description from a previous match report  Alice Hug retaliating with one of her infamous hits - that Graham deflected into the goal, despite it heading in the left bottom corner already.  Or as Graham described it in the pub afterwards: Graham scored a wonder goal from a short corner. 
In the unfamiliar right back position Jack Chalk unleashed an ariel bombardment that had Wisbech defenders (and on one occasion cheering supporters) wishing they had brought hard hats to the match.
In the 2nd half South faded and Wisbeach took control in the middle. The action moved towards the South goal and I couldnt see who made which telling contribution - but these are the points the team remembered in the pub.  
         Finns wonder save from a penalty corner (definitely missed this, must have been chatting)
         Dave Aston - slow and had a bad game as left back (In fact he was totally anonymous. I dont remember applauding or castigating Dave once. Somethings not right here!)
         2 good balls into the D (Only 2? No wonder South didnt score more) 
The pressure grew as Wisbech started to find their rhythm, scoring to equalise and then again to take the lead. However, South werent going to roll over without a fight. In a memorable moment Tom Watson tackled the Wisbech Stone Cold Austin double. The move, more often seen in the wrestling ring, involved Tom starting with flat stick tackle before helping Stone Cold over his shoulder. The Wisbech player took exception to this and received a yellow card to help him cool off.
Staring all sorts of lazy defeat based clichs in the face Richard Claes embarked on a mazy run. Somehow he avoided a series of last ditch tackles before rounding the keeper and dispatching into the goal. Parity! Just minutes later Richard embarked on another mazy run. Once again he evaded the defenders last ditch tackles, rounded the keeper and missed. And that was as close as South came to the winner that theyve recently become accustomed to. Although they were awarded a last short corner this time it wasnt to be.
The final point to mention was Tom Ws effort to unquestionably claim Lemon by trying to climb under an open gate. I missed this but from the description in the pub it sounds comedy gold.","Men's 1sts draw against Wisbech Town 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Just how much trouble Rutland is facing, was epitomised by one of their cars, trying its luck on just about every pitch in town before arriving at Catz a mere 5 minutes after the scheduled push-back. Considering that the missing players included the visitors goalie, it seemed only fair to give Rutland the time to get their players onto the pitch (if not necessarily warmed up).
Whether due to the warm-up, the buoyant spirit or the quality of the line-up, it was the home team that started their game with more verve. Solid work by Dom Nelson and Chris Pearson in central midfield saw the ball smoothly moving up to the rotating trio of Tom Howell, Ally Ward and Rob Barton upfront, while right-mid Ron Oren made good use of Rutlands total disregard for marking him. While much of the play was in and around the visitors D, South couldnt convert their chances into goals. In fact, it was Rutland that opened the score, when a quick break won them a short corner, which was duly dispatched past interim-goalie Chris Collinson.
At half-time, with a score line not reflecting play at all, the team unanimously decided to stop fannying about and start playing the hockey theyve shown in earlier matches. True to their word, the home side pressed hard throughout the second half, reducing Rutland to chancy long balls as the only way out of their own defence; with these mopped up through solid marking by Andy Passmore, Ian Glover and Tom Anns, or equally solid tackling by sweeper Paresh Parsot, the visitors could only manage one or two more shots at goal and saw those ably dealt with by a confident Chris C. 
At the other end of the pitch, meanwhile, chances were coming thick and fast, but goals were less easy to get by. In the end, it fell to Rob to get the equaliser, when a trademark duck-and-roll shot slipped past the keeper. Considering the score was only level and the clock a long way off 70 minutes, Robs slightly exaggerated celebrations could be considered a bid for the Lemon of Match award. A few minutes later, Tom H. showed that scorers can be dignified, too, after a short-corner resulted in a drag-flick into the top corner, contending for goal of the season. Playing out the clock more composedly than last week, the home side secured a confidence-boosting set of back-to-back wins for their efforts.
Although unfortunate not to score more against a weaker side, the team can be proud of their commitment and fighting spirit, pulling three well-deserved points out of the fire to get themselves closer to safety in the division.","Men's 2nds win again!

Taking the pitch with a 4-4-2 formation for the first time this season in an effort to neutralise Peterborough's strong midfield, South were determined to put in a solid performance. A large gathering of partisan home supporters added to the sense that this was a significant match for both teams.

It was clear right from the start that Peterborough had some very useful players with skills that South couldn't really match. But what we perhaps lacked in individual skill we more than made up for in teamwork and effort. The back four of Aston, Graveling, Johnson (F) and the fill-in Chalk all defended resolutely and with huge discipline, conceding very few short corners all game, much to their credit. The midfield spent most of the game harrying and challenging the opposition, with Virdi, Watson and Hawkes patrolling the flanks while Williams and McCulloch stuck like glue to their opposite numbers. A couple of South players even threw a few aerials up. Aerials! Whatever next..?

With so much commitment to defending strongly and marking closely, there wasn't much opportunity for the forwards Claes and Johnson (R). The odd chances we did get went agonizingly wide of a South stick in the opposition's D, and not a single short corner was awarded, despite some obvious Peterborough infringements. 

Half-time came and went with no score. Peterborough pushed harder in the second half and created some great chances - but Parker was equal to all but two of these. The first was inexplicably (but thankfully) missed from half a yard out by a Peterborough forward at the far post and the second was pulled away off the goal line at waist height with ninja reflexes by Johnson (F) - showing an ironic aptitude for cricket, a game he professes no interest in. Miraculous goal-line clearances are becoming a habit for the curly-haired (or is it straight...?) defender.

As time ticked away, a break-away by the lickety-split Claes had everyone dreaming of a cheeky 1-0 victory but the chance was snaffled up by the hastily retreating defence. As the intensity of the game increased, the tolerance of the umpires decreased. Following a couple of free-hits taken from the wrong place and an unfortunate misunderstanding about which side had committed an offence (yes - I'm being kind. For once.) Johnson (F) was shown the yellow card for his, shall we say, over-enthusiasm. The 'Defenders Card Competition' is hotting up... 

Fortunately Peterborough were unable to capitalize on the man-advantage and the final whistle eventually blew signalling much relief (and for a certain Mr Claes some not-so-subtle boisterous whoops of delight) for South. A fantastic team effort to keep our promotion hopes alive. ","Men's 1sts draw against City of Peterborough 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

I would normally then go on to describe the first half. Nothing happened. Ely had two shorts. South had one.  Steve touched the ball a couple of times.  Mark had a reverse stick shot past the post.   Bhav shouted a bit. 
At half time, captain McCulloch gave the team a deserved rollocking- there wasn't much vigour or urgency in anybody, and you could forgive the poor spectators who'd come to watch had they fallen asleep.
After the break, South were re-energised: its amazing what Lucozade can do.   After an initial short was snuffed out, SOuth built further attacks. A great run by Mark Williams up the left was followed by a reverse stick shot, which Rich Claes deflected in on the far post.  1-0, and the paltform for victory was in place.....
Or so it should have been.   After last week's titanic defensive display at Peterborough, South got into the Christmas spirit by giftwrapping an equaliser to Ely.   After an initial dangerous attack appeared to be snuffed out, South passed the ball directly to the Ely striker five yards out, who gratefully slotted home a goal my Grandma's neighbour's cat could have finished.
South were now in a game, but it was Ely with their tails up.   A short corner was won for the home side and was nailed home into the bottom corner.   2-1.
South huffed and puffed til the end of the match, but to no avail.   Ely saw out the game with relatively little danger of an equaliser, and South have now lost crucial ground on the leaders.   The game against Bourn after Christmas now has added importance, as unless South win, their promotion hopes may yet be dashed for another year.

South did however put in an excellent performance in the post match teas lemon voting, with some of the following lemon votes standing out:<ul>

South took the game to their lowly opponents straight from the off, with the wide players of Johnson (F) and Virdi looking to get round the back of the opposition to create chances for the forwards.   Many chances were created in the opening quarter, including a gilt-edged one for Average (needless to say he missed from 5 yards) before Chris Pearson netted home from the edge of the D after a neat team buildup.
The lead shouldve been built on, but South took their foot off the perennial gas, and Ives were soon level.   Their experienced centre forward slammed home a snap shot at the top of the area to take his side level.
South were jolted into action again, and soon re-gained the lead.   This time Mark Williams was the man of the moment, placing his shot with perfection on to the defenders outstretched stick to take it into the top right hand corner.   2-1.
However, South relaxed again, and St Ives, always dangerous had a chance to equalise from a short corner.   An excellent save from Shahbaz unfortunately landed right at the feet of the St Ives attacker, who pushed the rebound into the unguarded net.
At half time, the point was made that South were creating numerous chances and a third goal would come, but that they really needed to keep up their discipline and concentration to keep the opponents out.   Sure enough, chances did flow Souths way in the second half, and John Hawkes burst the net with a slammed strike from a short corner.   Or at least thats how he described it.
The game became more and more stretched late on as St Ives pushed for a winner, and it has to be said some indiscipline nearly cost South dear as many a short corner was conceded.   However George Wych was alert as ever on the runout to ensure that no further goals were conceded.

Competing with second-placed Spalding would always be a big ask, which was clear from the very beginning of the game, with the visitors starting the more energetic and dangerous. Solid defending, however, saw South ride out the initial storm and start their own forays into Spaldings defence. Admittedly, Spalding managed to put two goals past the home side, but those were mostly due to individual lapses of concentration; at half-time, South was very much still in the game.
And then it all went wrong. If books were written about this story, theyd be quite short. Nightmares would be rather gentle. The film seriously boring. Despite starting the second half strongly and sorting out some issues in defence, somehow South found itself completely outplayed for 30 minutes. Individual heroic acts may have stopped the score line from being even uglier and put some pressure on the visitors goalie, but as a whole the team just wasnt here. 
No permanent damage was done to Souths campaign for staying in Div3, but we cannot afford many more performances like this; some hard work must be put in to shake the Christmas cobwebs out of our heads and get the team back on track again.","Men's 2nds lose to Spalding 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Saturday's match was one of those games. As I really don't have masochistic tendencies I won't go into too many details. Just the facts.
One car only arrived at the ground 10 minutes after the (delayed) start of the match - by which time the outnumbered South were two goals down, albeit to two rather undeserved goals. With a full team on the pitch South then set about making amends. With even numbers of players, it was obvious that South had the more creative and persistent attacking opportunities. Spalding were reduced to pushes and stick tackles to stem the flow. After one such foul, Johnson (F) quickly took the free hit, bouncing it into the D where McCulloch speculatively deflected it into the corner of the goal, with the keeper still assuming it was lifted into the D and therefore wouldn't count. The umpire rightly ignored Spalding's protests and South were back in the game. Determined not to make that assist his main contribution to the game, Johnson (F) duly contrived to get himself yellow carded (once more) for putting in a couple of great tackles that the umpire took a disliking to. Watson meanwhile was getting even more creative - with his own speculative deflection beating the keeper nicely. However, despite his lottery-winner celebrations, the umpire politely pointed out that he was actually several yards outside the D at the time. Indeed he had barely reached the D before starting his celebration.
In the second half South continued to put pressure on Spalding, with Hawkes, Virdi and Chalk exploiting every gap through to the forwards Johnson (R) and McCulloch - and in one case (Virdi) even making use of the much-maligned 'squarial'. Injuries to Wych and then Johnson (F) - on top of the fiasco at the start and a yellow card - meant South were constantly forced to shuffle players around with Williams playing sweeper or centre-back for large periods of the game. Maintaining some structure and order to the team was almost impossible. Despite this, South kept pushing forward, with many attacks being started from the left and right by Aston and Read.  One such attack ended in another South goal as Chalk seized on a loose ball with the keeper on the floor like an upturned turtle and pushed it over the line to level the scores.
But it was not to be the comeback that South deserved. After a couple of half-chances went narrowly wide of the Spalding goal, Spalding managed to breach the South defense and score with only 2 minutes left on the clock. Time expired as South faced a rare Spalding short corner - which, in keeping with the way things were going for South that day, of course found the back of the net. A thoroughly undeserved defeat that South can rightfully feel frustrated about. With a full 11-a-side match things would certainly have been different. 
What will define this second half of the season is how South bounce back from this. A home fixture next Saturday against Wisbech 3s is the first step of that journey.","Men's 1sts lose to Spalding 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Confidence in the South side was low having had their pre-Christmas winning streak spectacularly demolished in their previous two games.
With the temperatures this week almost all thought the game would be off, and the -7C overnight temperature would surely seal the deal, but no, temperatures in Peterborough were a summery 1C upon arrival. A combination of people being late for the early morning meet and  the Highways Agency deciding that crucial A14 bridge repairs were required meant the journey up was at least eventful, with detours, traffic jams and slow moving police cars on the A14 all playing their part. One car arrived pitch side to be met with a frozen pitch, no home team and the thought the game would surely be called off, the 2nd car arrived with pretty much the same thought. The home team then casually emerged from their warm changing room ready to start the game with South still 1 car and 4 players down - why didn't we think of that! As the game was about to start Vice Captain Anns pulls into the car park with the remainder of the team and casually start making their way towards the pitch, a shouting at from the captain later and we nearly had a team ready to start the game. 
Early into the game it looked like it could be a long afternoon for South again, but after a quick reorganisation with everyone changed and in their actual positions everything was going to plan, we were almost out of our own half. After some solid tackling, some scrappy tackling, and a bit more tackling the ball fell to some Peterborough player at the top of the D who sent a flick towards the top corner and with Shabaz nowhere to be seen, he turned away thinking he scored, a flashing stick of Ian sent the ball flying down to 3rd Man for 4 runs, maybe England could take some pointers, Peterborough were in disbelief.
After this, the game became a more even contest, with everyone on the pitch playing at a much higher level than the previous two games. Just before half time a press of the Peterborough back line went disastrously wrong, the two midfielders were left completely unmarked, got the ball, waltzed into the D and South were in the familiar 1-0 down score line. Half time came and went quickly due to the late starting of the game, and early in the 2nd half the South D had to fend off wave after wave of attacks, most of which resulted in penalty corners which the home side failed to convert any of. Further pressure ensued from one of what seemed like 20 penalty corners with another strike on goal this time not being stopped by a stick or the keeper but by the player themselves. Could Shabaz pull off a similar save to the earlier strike against his helmet? He got a pad to the flick but couldn't keep it out. 
At 2-0 down again it would be a test of character, even the home crowd were laughing, mainly at a huge air-shot from Colin, but a good flowing move from right to left gave South their best chance of the game. Watson started it playing it inside to Colin who fed Nick the ball went out wide with Nelson providing a first time ball to Pearson at the far post, but a combination of the cold weather and ""too much time doing weights over Christmas"" meant he couldn't get to the pass. End to end hockey followed with another good move that ended with Tom Howell sliding across the D before firing a reverse stick strike into the top corner (well, maybe not quite the top corner but it went in nonetheless even though the home keeper might feel he could have done better). With 5 minutes to go could South pull off what would be one of their results of the season, and in turn do the 1s a massive favour against one of their rivals? Despite the effort of all involved we would come up short.
The teas in the bar that followed showed just how cold, or how cheap we are, with everyone opting for the free cup of tea rather than a drink for the bar, the hotdogs were good. Anns put in a valiant effort at trying to divert his lemon votes for his poor driving to Jimmy for uneven ketchup distribution, he promptly then spat it out all over the table. He sealed the votes by telling anyone who would listen that he had lost his crown jewels to the cold,  the club biscuit wrappers were put to good use.
Despite the loss for South we can be encouraged by what was described after the game as our best performance of the season, and losing to a team gunning for the title doesn't do our chances of avoiding relegation any damage, with the game next week against Ely carrying far greater importance.","Men's 2nds lose to City of Peterborough 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Fortunately the traffic was light and so Jack managed to make it in time for the game and we took to the pitch with a full complement of players.
The skippers pre-match talk reminded us that in the corresponding fixture of the first half of the season we had conceded 2 quick goals and had to fight back to equalise. We werent going to do that again .. so instead we scored 2 quick goals and let City fight back to equalise. 
The first 15 minutes of the match were all South, with Johnson (F) at the heart of most of the attacks. Maybe this was something to do with him having expectorated half his body-weight out onto the pitch in the team talk. In any event he was inspired throughout the match so we are now looking for Neil to provide CSHC-branded spittoons to save Mark having to use his astros to rub it into the pitch.
The first goal came from strong play in midfield from Finn who nicked the ball off his City opponent and fired a powerful cross to the back post that Graham got a sweet deflection onto to dink it over the floundering City keeper. Shortly after this South went 2-0 up when Finn (again) sent a lovely through ball to Rich Claes putting him one-on-one with the keeper who had a moment of madness and raced out of his area, thus allowing Claes to do what he does best - turn on the gas, get round him and place the ball in the net from an acute angle. 
Two goals to the good with a quarter of the match gone - it was like taking candy from a baby. And it should really have been 3-0 only when Hawkes managed to take a massive air shot right in front of goal when it seemed easier to score. However City were not beaten yet and to their immense credit they were not falling apart, shouting and swearing as one would usually have expected them to do; instead they built up some pressure of their own, particularly through their pacey centre forward, and came back strongly firstly with a short corner strike placed perfectly between Chris Graveling and goalie Steve Parker and then robbing the ball from Souths midfield after a long clearance and surging into the D to equalise.
So all square again but South remained upbeat; we knew that we were in a tough game but we also knew also that we were the better team and that confidence paid off as South moved up a gear as half time beckoned and forced a short corner which was played to a well-worked routine - injection to Jack who stopped perfectly, allowing Finn plenty of time to set up John Hawkes just to the right of the penalty spot. The South forward made no mistake this time, delicately placing the ball into the roof of the net. 
The message at half time was to keep pressing, be patient and remain positive and this approach worked well. Souths defence neutralised much of the City threat by stepping up to take the ball in front of their attackers which allowed the midfield and forward line to make use of space further up the pitch to pressure the opposition. 
At just one goal to the good South could not relax as City were still showing good resolve and creating the odd chance of their own. However, the game was put to bed with a 4th goal from South when Jack confused the City defence initially by pirouetting 4 or 5 times round in the D and then by firing off his classic spinny-drag-sweepy thing that he always tries in Summer Hockey. Even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day and much to everyones surprise it actually came off - delivering a perfect ball to Rich Claes who tapped in from a few feet out of the goal.
All in all an enjoyable game played out in good spirit between both teams. And there was still time for one final surprise after the whistle - Hawkes actually paid his match fees!","Men's 1sts beat local rivals Cambridge City 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Strengthened by newly recruited Charlie Douty and the selfless Russell Johnson, the team arrived at a bleak and windy pitch in high spirits, brimming with confidence and uncharacteristically early.
From the very beginning, the game was far more even than the respective league positions of the team would suggest. Although the home side did more of the attacking, it was South that got the first couple of chances, in the form of short corners; unfortunately, the pre-game short corner practice had obviously not been enough as both chances went unused. On the other side of the pitch things, luck was running differently: a lucky deflection off a short corner saw the home side gain a rather undeserved lead. Soon afterwards, keeper Shahbaz was left helpless again, when the tiniest of touches on the top of the D spun the ball into the corner, past even his cat-like abilities to dive.
Undeterred, the visitors kept pressing forward and they could be excused to feel, at half-time, that the game was not over yet. For Charlie, though, it would be soon: mere minutes into the second half, he showed his dedication to the team by taking a stick to the face and walking off the pitch leaving a trail of crimson droplets. In an impressive show of composure, he managed to apologise for the mess he was making of his newly green-and-red shirt. Luckily, we can report that, several hours at hospital and four stitches later, Charlies head is good as new!
Down to eleven men and with 30-odd minutes to play, it was back into the breach for South. Always sporting, Bourne Deeping offered the visitors a touch of rest, by dint of getting a forward sent off for trying (and failing) to shove Ron Oren off the ball. With play ranging up and down the pitch, chances were created on both sides, but none converted. Until the last few minutes, that is, when Bourne Deeping managed to get a 2-on-1 in the visitors D and duly dispatched the ball for a third goal.
The score line certainly didnt reflect the game, with South deserving a lot more. However, the team can take pride in their performance, showing that we can compete with the stronger sides in the league.

In the left back position, Dave Aston received a pass, and strove to throw an airial so high it cleared the Neots side fence.

Back to the match, South were beginning to string a couple of opportunities together- some eye-of-a needle passes from Hawkes setting up some fantastic opportunities which went to no avail.   So Jonny H took it upon himself to nail a strike into the bottom of the goal following a short corner.   One nil.
The rest of the half was pretty routine- a couple of smart stops from short corners by Steve Parker but otherwise pretty cagey, until Dave Aston, in the corner, played a great reverse clearance down the line.....except he hooked it square and infield and was lucky to see it cleared up by his defensive partners.   This drew a significant groan of ""what are you doing!"" from Hawkes but perhaps more amusingly, the Neots skipper berated his own attacker for ""not anticipating it.""
Jokes aside, at half time, stand in skipper Williams stressed that South were playing well but just needed to keep their discipline and the second goal would surely come.   As the second half wore on, it was clear that Neots were tiring and the pace of Watson, Johnson Chalk and Claes was beginning to open them up.  Watson had a baseball swing shot canon off the bar but the score still stood at one nil.
And after a few cagey moments at the back, the second goal came.   If it were a girl, it would have been Megan Fox.   If it were a footballer it would have been Lionel Messi.   Described by some as a ""rare but sexy strike"" (personally it didn't make me orgasm, but each to their own) and others as ""the greatest goal in club history,"" Bav picked up a loose ball at the top of the D and unleashed Damien Rice canonball of a shot into the top of the net.   If you were there, you would remember this goal for the rest of your life I guarantee you.   It was certainly much better than John's goal.
Relief spread through the side after the second goal- only five minutes to go, and South saw out the match in relative comfort.   They now have 5 matches left till the end of the season, and 5 more professional performances should see them complete another strong season in Div 3NW.

The match started at a decent pace with all 22 players clearly looking forward to the challenge, the sides exchanged brief periods of possession and had a short corner each before the games opening goal, frustratingly, it went to the 2s. The 1s should have marked a lot tighter during the build-up and perhaps showed a bit of complacency in their final line of defence but Barton still had a lot to do and rounded his man and Steve Parker in goal with great composure.
The 1s responded well to going behind and began to show a significant threat going forwards, particularly down the right channel. Some sloppy tackling from the 2s in their 25 allowed the pressure to be increased through a series of short corners, one of which was expertly dispatched by Dave Aston with a bullet drag flick right into the top corner, Shahbazs full length dive only serving to make Astons effort look even more spectacular.
The 1s continued to press forward and would have taken the lead after a goalmouth scramble had it not been for a slightly premature whistle from the umpire. From the resulting short corner, Jon Hawkes tried his hand at the flick routine but his average effort was well saved by Shahbaz.
The second half was played in much the same vein with the 1s having the lions share of the ball but struggling to break down the stubborn 2s defence who got back in numbers and worked very hard to close their men down. Eventually the 1s regained their lead but only through another short corner routine. This time the ball wasnt stopped as intended and the advantage would have been lost had Aston not had the guile and skill to move the ball past the first runner and then unleash an unstoppable reverse stick shot that scorched past defenders and keeper alike before rewarding Aston with that beautiful double thud sound as it smashed into the side board and then immediately on the back board. Astons celebration was as cool as the finish, arrogantly flicking up his collar and raising his arms in the air, Cantona style, as his jubilant teammates admiringly congratulated him. 
Despite pressing forward for much of the remainder of the game the 1s didnt look like scoring again but as the ball was being kept in the attacking third it also looked unlikely that they would concede. How wrong they were! With 5 minutes to go the 2s launched a fast break that was initially rebuffed however, their battling spirit shone through and the first XI back four didnt react quickly enough to the second ball allowing Dom Nelson to pounce like a cat and slot the ball past Parker.
With only a few minutes remaining, the game was up! The 1s hadnt threatened their opponents goal from open play in the first 65 minutes so were unlikely to do so as the game fizzled out. 
The 2s fully deserved the point for their hard work but if the 1s had been able to pass the ball better and breach their opponents D, the game could have been won at half time.","Men's 1sts draw with club rivals Cambridge South 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

And what better way to do this, than taking on their intra-club rivals in a showdown at the crack of dawn?
Having overcome Mark Williams cunning ploy of providing the wrong starting time to key members of the 2s squad, it was the brilliantly bedecked men in yellow (and pink in one memorable occasion) that started out the most enterprising, probing the 1s defence with simple play and decisive passes from the midfield. At the receiving end of one of those, Rob Barton showed a flash of genius and commendable calm to twist away from his marker and beat the leagues best keeper in a 1-on-1 and put the 2s ahead.
As the 1s started to settle and pressed forward, it was the 2s defence that started to get tested, resulting in a string of short corners. Despite heroics by rushing defenders and Shahbaz, nobody could stop the flick going straight into the top corner. Various chances came and went on either side, without any further score (albeit in one case assisted by fortuitous umpiring).Half-time and the score was all square at 1-1.
The 2s smelt blood and came into the second half all guns blazing. Unfortunately, so did the 1s, who were getting more and more frustrated with the 2s stubborn refusal to roll over and die. Even after a second goal snuck through the 2s defence, the game remained hotly contested, with both teams pushing forward as much as possible. Had there been any neutral observers, they wouldve undoubtedly called it riveting end-to-end stuff. It seems only fair that the game ended in style - another determined attack by the 2s saw the ball into Dom Nelson in the D; he didnt stop to question how it got through, but simply slipped it into the far corner to secure an unexpected, but deserved point for the 2s league campaign.
Once again, the 2s showed that they can compete with any team in this league, as long as they keep the drive and determination for the full 70 minutes. Credit where credits due, though - we still need to work on our comedy lemon votes, if we want to challenge the 1s in that department...

Shame that nobody had thought to inform the College teams playing that wed like to warm-up, so that they kept the pitch occupied until the dot of 10:30. With schedules tight, five minutes to tap a ball back and forth was all that wed get before the fun started for real.
Was it that they were the home team, who didnt have to shake the ride from the Fens from their legs? Or the buzz of last weeks success? Or maybe it was the alcohol still resident in some peoples bloodstream... Whatever caused it, it was the home team that started out the brightest, pressing Wisbech back towards their d with patient, simple hockey. Indeed, it wasnt long before a pass through the defence saw Jimmy Liu through on the keeper. Showing the composure in the D that the 2s have been lacking so often, Jimmy calmly slotted the ball onto the backboard to give South the lead.
By now, though, Wisbech had found their legs and started to push back on their own. Play surged back and forth with chances falling on either side, but the defences held. Half-time came and South was still ahead by a nose.
In the second half, Wisbech clearly felt their deserved more than an impending defeat and kept pressing forward, searching for that equaliser. As the South defence remained rock-solid, the visitors started to get frustrated and the game became more of a physical affair. Once again, though, the home team kept its head, refusing to rising to any bait. Instead, they decided to take their revenge on Wisbech with another goal; admittedly, this one was more of a scramble than the first one, but they still count. 2-0 to South and steam was positively coming out of Fenlanders ears... Desperate efforts by Wisbech notwithstanding, there wouldnt be a difference to the score and South notched up their first win of the season with more than 1 goals difference. They may not be safe yet from relegation, but 3 points added to the haul are certainly a step in the right direction.","Men's 2nds beat Wisbech Town 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

This weeks installment had it all; action, passion, ""skill"", aggression, anger, amateur dramatics and a beautiful tale of romance to keep the whole family enthralled. This week South 1's ventured once more to the land of webbed hands, webbed feet, extra fingers, extra toes and of course the precursor to all of this, Dave's Mum. For a couple of hours, Dave was going home.

South's fearsome dictator in charge (General Vladimir McColug) had now returned from a trip to Russia assisting with the election process. Having reflected on South's current 4th place standing under his iron fist, zero tolerance regime (fractionally ahead of the days oppo), the General opted for a new strategy - the troops were to ""enjoy"" themselves. Or so this was to be the official line. This ""enjoyment"" commenced with an enforced stop at sports nutritionist Dr. M C Donald on the way. Loyal footman J.Hawkes was one of three selected subjects picked (apparently at random) for the session. An eye witness at the scene (who has asked to remain anonymous) stated that the fearsome General ordered Hawkes to consume many of the Dr's supplements, claiming that they would aid his performance and ""help the team"". Hawkes, entirely unsuspecting of any ulterior motivation behind the General's orders, duly followed the commands.

Upon arrival at the Stade de Webb, the atmosphere was electric with an air of anticipation. For this week Nicky Briscow was returning to action. His latest injury, an itchy rash, had cruelly ruled him out for most of the season, but a strong course of (curiously) vagisil had apparently cured the ""area"". The excitement was short lived however, as 79 seconds into the first half Nicky was seen limping off the pitch with reports of a scratching action.

The troops, slightly disheartened to see the demise of Nicky, fought on valiantly, quickly tearing holes in the oppo's defense. With 8 minutes on the clock a beautiful passage of play culminated in a one in a million pass from loyal servant Hawkes to the General, providing South with a golden opportunity to score. With an elated scream of ""goal king"" the general unleashed a terrifying air shot at the desperate oppo goal. Unfortunately the General did not quite get the correct air angle on the ball and the chance went begging.

South continued to press hard and were eventually rewarded with a short corner after a one in a million foot from a consistent Hawkes. Average smelt glory. Having so expertly drag flicked in the previous week, he stepped up to the D, expressing nothing but the cute slight smile of a 5 year old boy. The flick was executed beautifully, only to be saved by a one in a million save by the oppo goal keeper. Average looked gutted. The smile had gone, until something unexpected happened. A skillful oppo player (curiously absent from the sides' previous encounters) commended Average on an outstanding effort, and particularly his ""lovely lines"". All of a sudden the smile was back, and some. The remainder of Averages match consisted of an enchanting love story of magnitudes last seen in a documentary on the Titanic, and as such cannot be accurately or sufficiently depicted in mere words so I will leave this story to Celine.

Half time was soon called with neither side having impacted the scoreline. Unfortunately the contents of the half time address by the General cannot be disclosed due to sensorship rules under the regime.

With the second half underway something was immediately apparent. Hawkes, having impressed in the 1st half, looked to be struggling. Spectators present at the game (also requesting anonymity) stated that it looked as though he might have been deliberately poisoned or deliberately over/force fed just before the game. (Please note that these views were expressed by independent primary witnesses and are in no way representative of the views of the author).

With star point scorer Nicky Briscow sidelined and loyal team player Hawkes inhibited, there was a genuine fear that South could crumble, until a young buck by the name of E Reed stepped up to the plate. In what some have speculated was a potential MoM winning performance (and with that a healthy haul of fantasy points that aren't at all coveted by any members of the team) ER showed flair, charisma and power. Unfortunately it was to be short lived. Suddenly, out of no where, ER was cut down by a sniper's bullet. A sickening, gut-wrenching scream was the first anyone new of this - the gravity of the situation was instantly understandable by the severity of the scream. Speculation that the sniper may have been of Russian origin has been widely dismissed by officials following a conspiracy theory anonymously uploaded to the net claiming that ER had been quoted as saying that ""the bullet felt Russian"" and claims by multiple sources that General McCulog was apparently seen talking into a water bottle moments before the strike. The General's number 1, Pavel M Williams, responded aggressively to such accusations implying that any such slanderous comments would be ""dealt with"".

The scream happened to coincide with the only goal of the game. With everyone's attention drawn by the assassination attempt, the general seized on this opportunity to push the ball into the oppo goal. Despite protests by the oppo several minutes later when everyone realised what the General had done, the goal was allowed on a technicality as the umpires, rushing to the aid of ER, had not blown their whistles.

The spectators were treated to a controlled performance by South for the remainder of the game, where South calmly retained possession in the safety of the oppo half to see out the win. A glorious aerial from the Karachi King, a persistent attacking threat from Justin Claes, handbags (and helmets) at dawn from Stevey ""nobody touches my kit"" Parker and the weekly request by the umpire for F. Johnson to shut up were just some of the highlights.

And so the game ended with a 1-0 victory for South. A ""democratic"" vote was held after the game in order to elect a MoM and LoM. General McCulog took control of the voting procedure and responsibility for the counting of the ballot along with his number 1 Pavel M Williams. A somewhat surprising result emerged where the General himself received a 63% majority to take the MoM award. As surprising was that Hawkes received the LoM award. No reasons were provided for the awards. Due to the General's long association and experience with voting processes it was deemed that the result was accurate and that no recount was required.","Men's 1sts narrowly beat Wisbech Town 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

It all started badly when one of the cars managed to miss the one pitch in the league you could find with your eyes closed and didnt get to pitch until a mere 20 minutes before push-back. Between lacking players and lacking urgency, South didnt get their warm-up organised in time and started the game with cold limbs and fuzzy heads.
And boy, did it show. Rutland didnt show much in skill, but South seemed to make a conscious effort to match them for it. Impartial sideline observers were seen to slit their wrists with boredom, when - somewhat against the run of play - a goal was scored. Unfortunately for South, it was the home side that scrambled the ball over the line to give them a 1-0 lead. And so it stayed for quite a while.
Second half and South resolved to up their game and show what they can do. True to their word, they did and pressed Rutland hard. In one of those attacks, Colin Troll managed to fire off a shot at goal from the narrowest of angles and miss is by such a margin that Laurens Brocken found himself with an easy tap-in at the far post. 1-1 and South were surging. For all of 3 minutes and then the team did a credible imitation of an undercooked souffl and slumped into a rather unappetising shape. Although the visitors had most of the game for the rest of the half and created a buck-load of chances, finishing clearly wasnt on the cards. On the other side of the pitch, Rutland got themselves one short corner and managed to bundle that into goal off Shahbazs pads. South kept trying and kept dominating the game outside the D; but they fell prey to panic in the last quarter - rather beautifully epitomised by Tom Annss annual shot on goal (and I use the word goal in the loosest possible sense) that nearly decapitated several players and the umpire (on the other side of the pitch).
In the end, the team had to concede defeat and leave Uppingham empty-ended. The anti-relegation campaign is not quite dead yet, but next weeks game against St Neots is now taking on epic proportions: in effect, South have one last chance to show that they actually deserve to stay in 3NW.

That sounds simple, but with two players hot-footing it out after doubling up 2s in Cambridge, two stuck behind the cyclists of the Tour de GB, one missing on Grange Road and the rest of us nearly waylayed in a pile-up on the A14, it really wasn't...  Add to this that we were coming out after two heavy defeats with a team changed yet again, and it is even more impressive that South dominated the match from the start.  Good communication, strong passing and a real determination to win every ball meant most of the game was played in the opposition half.  The 3-4-3  formation provided strength in midfield and Lauren, Lindsey and George passed the ball around, maintaining possession as a consequence.  The first half goal came from penetrating run and pass from Lindsey that found it's way to Serin who decisively finished it.

A second half switch saw old 2nd team-mates Bex and Sam reunited on the right with Bex leading some great pressure deep in the opposition half, despite the fact that St Ives had brought their strongest players back into defence.  St Ives, were a strong team with plenty of subs and our team tired a little so there was plenty of defensive work to do.  That started in the opposition half with Alice running a tight press and continued further back with tight marking and a consistent spoiling of St Ives' attacks (notably by new girl Lou's great performance) so overall Loopy in goal had remarkably little to do.  Gaining confidence, South started to run with the ball, passed well and put a lot more pressure on the Saint's D than was reflected in the score line.  Once again, it was usual defender Serin, demonstrating commendable composure in the circle, who scored from the left post after the ball rebounded around the circle from a number of sticks.

Overall, an awesome turn-around for the team.  There is plenty to work on (fitness, receiving passes cleanly, working the ball effectively around the circle) but from this base of enthusiasm, good communication and good possession play, we can hope to make this result typical for the season.

Their opportunities came from some sustained pressure on the South D, reflecting that there were gaps in marking in midfield. After a change in formation to a more defensive set-up, we managed to put in some nice passages of play. Despite this Wisbech managed another goal on the break from open play.
Both South goals came in the 2nd half from great passing moves on the break from defence with Alice smartly finishing the first and Lindsey's goal coming courtesy of a Wisbech defender smartly finishing a great cross initially targeted to Serin. Good points were a great work ethic from the whole team, notably to improve a lot in the second half to produce some sustained pressure in attack, and some nice passages of passing play from defence and midfield.

Alice's goal came from a well worked move that took the ball to the baseline then up to find her on the penalty spot to finish cleanly with a sweep shot.

In the second half the South players' physical fitness let us down and rather than settling down to consolidate our advantage, ambition led the team to continue to press forwards.  As a result, there were big holes in the middle of the pitch with numerous unmarked players proving too much for the South back line.  Rutland skillfully took the advantage with passing play (just the kind of stuff we'd done well in the first
half) and scored two goals on the break, with Loopy having little chance left one-on-one against the through runners.

South need to take the positives (excellent passing, good press, lots of pressure on goal) from the first half and learn the lessons from the second.  That is, either turn up with fully charged batteries or be ready to play boring, defensive hockey and hang on to a lead when we are tired.

Initial pandemonium with players playing for the wrong team and turning up to the wrong pitches, led on to South collecting themselves for a strong start following a rousing team talk from Captain Ellie. Possession was predominately ours for all of the first 15 minutes, with some excellent passing around the midfield and some shots in the D. However, Rutland began to fight back and after 20 minutes were awarded a short corner.  Unfortunately the straight strike resulted in a deflection off a South defender past Loopys pads.
Despite this initial set back, with encouragement from our much appreciated supporters of HABs (husbands and boyfriends) and some of the mens 1s, South showed real determination and immediately went on the counter attack. Demonstrating her dribbling skills, Bex took the ball past a number of Rutland players and slipped the ball to Georgie who then nudged the ball on to Alice at the top of the D. The ball was struck with an almighty thwack and flew into the goal through the keepers legs.
 Feeling confident, the second half began positively for South with more possession and some great runs/passing up the left by Birgit and Serin in to the opposition D. This ultimately resulted in South gaining a short corner, which after receiving the ball on her strong side from Bexs push out, Georgie hit straight in to the right hand corner of the goal. Rutland then proceeded to have several breaks which were effectively mopped up by Lindsey, Ellie, Julie and Lou. The new V defending formation was put in to play and worked well (thanks David). It was only upon the award of another short corner for Rutland that they were able to equalise, despite the excellent first save by Loopy of the straight strike. 
By this point, it was clear that the Southern girls were not going to let their hard work end in a draw. They surged forward again with another break and won a final short corner. After some slightly chaotic and nail biting scrabbling around the goal, Bex pushed the ball over the line for a very well deserved third goal for South. 
Despite another last ditch attempt by Rutland to score off a short in the last few minutes of the game, South were able to hold on to their league and were thrilled when the final whistle blew!  A great result for a tough game against very able opposition. Hopefully South can take confidence from the improved team work on display and give Peterborough a run for their money next Saturday!

The game was hard fought with a tendency for us to return to our pattern of play earlier in the season: South spent protracted periods of time in the attacking half but failing to score.  That was in large part to an experienced, solid Wisbech defensive line whose players doggedly and skillfully guarded their D without conceding fouls so that South never really looked at risk of scoring.  The Wisbech goal came from a short corner in the first half and was swept in off the rebound, sneaking behind Ali's pads after she'd made a great initial save.  

South's strong points were great domination in attack and mostly in defence but the game was marred by South dissent about umpriring causing much bad feeling.  The team need to work to be more positive on the pitch and creative and hardworking in evading the strong defenders who we inevitably meet at this level.  Anne Horan was awarded man of the match for a great game at centre back, keeping a close hold on her player and distributing the ball with great insight to set up new attacks.

Our opposition were second in the league with a good track record at home, so a final outcome of 4-0 is perhaps not surprising, though disappointing.  The South team worked hard in defence, doing well to close down the majority of Spalding's attacking play and earning Lou Cantwell the man of the match award for her consistently calm head and strong skills as the last line of defence (and nominations for the keeper and the rest of the defensive line).  
Three of the Spalding goals came from short corners and one from open play, again exposing our weakness under sustained defensive pressure.  
We struggled to consistently clear the ball through the midfield but did maintain some great periods of pressure in the opposition 25, sadly without managing to convert that into goals either from open play or several shorts.  The result leaves the L1s 6th from a league of 9 at the season's half way point.  There's much to do after Christmas but lots of positives given that this is a team which lost around half its regular players at the end of last season so are new at working together.","Ladies' 1sts lose to Spalding Ladies 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

The plan was to bamboozle our opposition with cheerfulness (and sort out the press, and score goals) and it all went just dandy.  Lindsey set the tone for the match with an independent move from right mid, along the baseline and directly into goal after about 10 minutes.  Sawtry put plenty of pressure on the defence who did well not to concede many shorts and keep the backboard unblemished, in large part to the atheleticism of the flying lemon Loopy, who earned herself the man of the match award for her efforts.

In the second half, a move for Georgie to the front of the diamond was quickly rewarded as she proceeded to score once herself (at the end of a great team effort to pass the ball around the circle and find a gap on the goal line) then set the next one up with a cross to Laura who swept the ball in from the near post.  Sawtry's goal strictly is reputed to have come off one of their feet, but was impressive and perhaps deserved nonetheless.

Overall, a great day of hockey with a lovely team spirit with hard work and good skills from everyone on the pitch.

The Rutland team appeared to have an average height of 5'2"" and age of 13.  However, inside knowledge tells us there was an ex England player amongst their ranks and they are a lot older than they look.  That experience was reflected in their dominance of the first half where the were strong on the break and scored (once from open play and another time from a short).  A half time reshuffle of the Cambridge team meant we were stronger defensively and put sustained pressure on the Rutland circle in the rest of the match.  Laura's goal was a great deflection from the near post at a short corner and, along with great movement and passing, earned her the man of the match award.  
We were unlucky not to make the final score 2-2 with several near misses on the Rutland goal and their final winner the result of a lucky deflection at a short corner.

Peterborough had some success breaking down the middle of the pitch, but were mopped up well by the defence, including some great saves by Loopy.
In the second half we improved the press and made Peterborough work harder to get up the field. However they managed to play some nice possession hockey and put more sustained pressure on us, eventually levelling the scores. Bex on her first match back since injury had now got into her stride and marked her return with first a good run onto the post to turn a cross in, and then a perfectly angled strike from the top of the D which headed into the far corner of the goal agonisingly beyond the goalkeeper's outstretched leg.
Peterborough kept on making us work hard, and scored with a straight strike from a short corner. However the team stayed positive and worked well together to close out the match for the win.

We were forgetting, though, that these are no ordinary students, but Cambridge undergraduates, and as such are a) competitive enough to stay sober the night before any game and b) wouldn't know how to party that hard anyhow.  Shame!  We got a 6-0 drubbing reflecting their great play (strong passing play and superbly well drilled short corner routines) and our inability to consistently string together passes and link play from defense to the opposition D.  
Despite this, everyone worked hard and there were great efforts defensively from the whole team, notably Serin and Liles in midfield and from the flying lemon and man of the match Ellie at the back.
This was a bit of a disappointing end to the league season but one which leaves us solidly in the middle ranks of the Cambridge Premier division table.  An excellent result from a team which started the season having lost almost half its regular players and then more to injury as the year went on.  It reflects the hard work of old stalwarts and, most encouragingly, the great performance of newcomers to the team this year and, along with similar results for the 2nds, puts the ladies' side of the club in strong position to approach next season.","Ladies' 1sts v Cambridge University Ladies 3 : Awaiting Result","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Ash and Jo Read also had a few close misses. Then Ely started to come back into the game, with some skilful runs putting pressure on our goal. We defended hard and made some timely interceptions and a half time score of 0-0 was fair.  The second half unfortunately was all about Ely. We struggled to clear out from the 16 and there were wave after wave of Ely attacks. Ali was absolutely amazing in goal - saving  from all angles whatever was thrown at her. Then Ely were awarded a penalty flick where a ball heading for goal hit a defenders foot with Ali in front of the last defender. The Ely captain placed the ball on the p spot and it was her vs Ali G.  Boyakasha! Ali saved the goal off her right leg so the score remained 0-0. The Ely wave continued and a break through the middle led to a tap in goal for their centre forward with about 5 mins to go. We tried to come back but unfortunately ran out of time.  Well get them next time though!

Then we came back in it with some great breaks from our forwards particularly Ash Price. Anne Horan and Claire Sherwood in the centre also made some telling tackles and some good passing led to pressure on the Huntingdon goal. Half time arrived and some tactical changes were made and this time it was our turn to come out of the blocks quicker.

Kylie Beasley was fantastic in the centre of midfield and a good break and strike led to a rebound shot being put away by Ami Chaplin.  1-0 South.  City came back and some stirling defence from Anne Horan at Centre back and Vicki Lavis at Sweeper kept City at bay.

Ley was perfectly positioned on the opposite post and tapped in Ashs shot. 1-0 South. Spalding regrouped and started to pass the ball around well and showed some good individual skill. However, our defence and midfield held up with some good tackles. Then the attack of the shorts began. Im not entirely sure how many short corners Spalding had in the entire game as I lost count after the first 5! The short corner defensive line of Lou G, Pip, Lydia, Lyn and of course Ali G in goal held firm and continued to clear our lines.

An evenly contested bout with telling tackles on both sides, then a break from Spalding found their centre forward at the top of the D who timed the hit perfectly (unfortunately) and the ball raced into the bottom right corner of Alis goal just high enough to get over Alis foot. 1-1.

In what is now our traditional 'season opener', Cambridge South took a squad of lean, mean, and less-rusty-than-you-might-think hockey players to Bishop's Stortford's annual Pre-Season Tournament. Last year we lost in the semi-final with a brand new 1st team line-up. This year we were keen to try a few new players out and increase our sharpness and fitness.
'A game of two halves' - that's the cliche. Well, this was a tournament of two halves. On the Saturday the sun blazed down on us as we romped to victory in all three of our matches with some swift, flowing attacks and tidy defending. On the Sunday the rain poured down as we battled to two very respectable results against last years winners and the team that proved to be this years winners.
I wouldn't dream of boring you with the details, so here's some highlights:
<ul><li>Rich Claes' first goal for the 1sts - a mazy solo run through the heart (*ahem*) of Hertford's defence followed by a cool flick past the keeper.</li>
<li>Watching on as Harleston Magpies fell on their swords, generously kicking and/or deflecting in all three of our goals to give us a victory that we still felt we deserved.</li>
<li>Resting in the shade after our 2nd match while our opponents in the 3rd match, Vauxhall, ran themselves ragged playing football. (We duly destroyed them in our match).</li>
<li>Playing against our own Simon Ta, who sportingly played as a ringer for Harleston Magpies. Always a pleasure, Si ;-)</li>
<li>Mark's ingenious strategy of getting his short-corner drag-flicks to bounce just before the keeper - plenty more goals where that one came from!</li>
<li>The burger van chaps who were very sympathetic to our elite calorie-loading requirements...</li>
<li>The entire team's defensive effort and coordination against Old Bordenians. Only a bullet of a shot from their very talented center-forward after we'd naively stopped for a foot-offense cost us the match.</li>
<li>Another gritty performance from a now-weary side in the semi-final against Old Loughts Foresters, proving we can - and should - play at a higher level than Div 3NW.</li>
<li>George's penalty-flick. Apparently Bishop's Stortford have had to order a new goal after the cross-bar was broken in two ...</li></ul>
Overall, a massively encouraging start to the season. I can't imagine there are any teams in the league that can match us for pace. Having retained nearly all of last year's squad we are playing well as a team already, and there are some exciting additions to the squad that will hopefully bring the goals we were lacking last season. 
Thanks to all the players for their efforts over the weekend, and to Bishop's Stortford Hockey Club for hosting another excellent tournament.

A shortage of players among the lower teams led to the two scheduled Royston vs Cambridge South games being merged into one, the resulting surfeit of players leading to a decision to play three 30-minute periods.

The new season rustiness was evident even before the game: the meet at Madingley Park & Ride had failed to specify a location, leading to several members circling the car park hoping to intersect with their teammates through some form of Brownian motion. Further chaos was added due to the late change in the meet time as a result of the fixtures merge, with several players still under the impression that the meet was at 12pm rather than 11am. A series of confused phone calls eventually got everyone heading in the right direction, albeit half an hour late and at varying times and from varying directions.

When all had finally assembled at Bassingbourne barracks the decision to play 90 minutes was rapidly being regretted. Yes, our arrival at the pitch coincided with the morning's friendly overcast skies giving way to piercingly ferocious sunshine.

With several new players, a squad of 16, rolling substitutes, debilitating heat and a new 4-3-3 formation, this was very much a bedding-in game for South. Despite this, and despite the presence of a number of Royston players clearly dropping down several levels, South worked hard and the score at the first interval remained level at 0-0. Dave Monck's ferocious hitting was clearing the lines from the back with new addition Nathan Monck running hard on the wings. Another new boy, Nick Venner, was showing his speed and dribbling skills up front, presenting the clearest South threat. Revived with the traditional orange segments brought by Neil Sneade, South prepared to resume the struggle

For the second period, the blazing sun and a lack of early season match fitness, particularly against a younger team, began to take their toll. South were more on the back foot and, after several good saves by man-of-the-match keeper Chris Collinson, Royston eventually got their opening goal. South's best chance came from a Dave Monck strike, arrowing inside the post (so he claims) until Paul South showed lightning reactions to deflect the ball in mid-air (the ball was in mid air, not Paul) safely wide of the Royston goal.

By the final period, the water had run-out, the energy was running out and in the wilting heat the motivation was beginning to disappear over the horizon too. Royston's steady pressure finally brought rewards with 3 more goals to settle the tie. Along the way though, a great run and pass from debutant captain Simon Jelley teed up Dom Nelson for South's first goal of the season.

A strange game to open the season and refinements are obviously still required to South's set-up in their new formation but persisting with an attacking set-up will be essential if the 3s are to challenge for promotion this season.

First goal was scored by South from a move down the right with the ball ended up left side of the goal on Paul South's reverse stick, who duly scored with a reverse stick shot. John Greaves then scored 1 to make it 2:0, but the author some how missed that.  Richard M scored one from a short corner, but that was disallowed.
Newmarket had numerous chances and were dominating larger proportion of the possession. They managed to get one back via some good passing amongst their forwards.  South changed their formation to 4:4:2 in order to get more control of the midfield.  We were rewarded with a 3rd goal just before half time with James Raikes applying the finish after some neat passing, again down the right.
The second half saw South taking more control of the midfield with the commendable Ian Marshman proving more than a match for the younger Newmarket players.
Notably young Nathan's speed took him past the older defender once or twice. In one run, after spectacularly going past a defender, he was darting goal-wards when a late stick tackle foiled him.  The half was ""shared"" with 2 goals from each side. South scorers were John Greaves and Davenport Monck from a short corner.

Still, after blocking up most of Grantchester Road for half an hour, we eventually made it onto the beach *ahem* I mean pitch. Cambridge City, despite finishing 4th in the division above us last season, showed no complacency and were obviously taking this meeting seriously (word must have gotten out about our skillz...), putting us to shame with their rigorous warm-up. Which, as it turned out was ironic, as we then proceeded to put them to shame with our rigorous match-play. 
Having gotten away quite lightly on TheWeekendWhenEveryoneGotMarried, South 1s were only missing the (used to be) ever-dependable Williams in center-mid and any sort of a recognized sweeper. After a long pre-match discussion on who should sweep (during which even the name 'Johnson' was uttered...) Sinclair manfully stepped up - and duly put in an assured performance at the heart of every defensive moment and the start or every attacking one.  Right from the first whistle South looked more organised and creative. Pretty soon City were resorting to heaving aerials to get the ball out of their defence. Watson and Johnson were harrying well up front, Virdi was snapping at the heels of his opposite number all game and Chalk was intercepting and distributing like a man on a mission. It was all looking good. City were worried. So of course we went and conceded a goal. A slight mix-up in defence allowed the City front line in. Parker saved the first shot but with no-one on hand to clear the rebound, the City attacker promptly stuck it in the back of our net. 
Twenty minutes into the game and South were still looking the better team, mopping up City's indecisive passes and attempted dribbles and mounting our own attacks with pace. It was only our decision making (as Sinclair pointed out in the post-match analysis) that let us down, with some beautiful passes going into empty space and some less-beautiful passes going into City sticks. With most of the 1st half gone, Ta decided it was probably time to make an appearance at the pitch. With Ta coming on at center-forward with fresh legs South suddenly had someone getting into those empty spaces to collect the balls played through by Hawkes, Chalk and Virdi. Shortly before half-time South broke through, when Ta pounced on the ball in the D and from the tightest of angles somehow managed to squeeze the ball through an invisible gap between the keeper and the post. 1-1 at half-time and our tails were up.
The second half was punctuated with the odd moment of solid passing play with Aston in particular looking assured, some surging runs down the left wing from Watson and some incisive tackling from the likes of Hawkes, Read and Wych. But mostly South stuggled to put it all together, resulting in a disappointing lack of real chances. The frustration was evident and indeed the umpires nearly stopped the clock at one point as South players scrambled to pick up all the toys that Aston had thrown out of his pram following some more imaginative defending from Chalk. Honourable 'Lemon' mention to both of them for that particular incident!
Just when we thought a draw might be a fair result, City caught the South defence on the back foot and, after a quick couple of passes, the winger ran the ball into the D and slotted it past the onrushing Parker. South continued to push forward from the restart, searching for another equalizer. Eventually a short corner was won (South's first of the match) and the final whistle went - signalling this would be the last play of the game. With a great track record from shorts, there was an air of expectancy. This was definitely going in. No doubt about it. Except that McCulloch injected the ball to the wrong stopper, Virdi had to improvise, and the resulting shot, although stingingly powerful, was too high. If only we hadn't listened to our coach about that 'Double Castle' short-corner routine... 
All banter aside, South can be encouraged that City (on paper a stronger side) struggled for large periods of the game against us. With a settled side (hopefully including the sublime Sinclair!) we should be turning these good passages of play into goals. A great effort from everyone in what was an exhausting 70 minutes of hockey! ","Men's 1s narrowly lose to rivals City","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

With a few new faces in the team, it was hardly surprising that the visitors started out of the blocks better than we did. One of the earliest attacks saw the Stortford attackers respond faster to keeper Shahbaz Alis save and slot in an easy goal. Scant minutes later, 16 hits proved - yet again - to be our Achilles heel. Having made some room to receive Colin Trolls hit, skip Ron Oren promptly fluffed up his stop, handing ball, room and opportunity to a pouncing attacker. The latter didnt want to seem ungrateful and quickly dispatched the ball behind virtually powerless Shahbaz. Two-nil down within 10 minutes, the home side finally woke up and started stringing passes together. Hard work by Alasdair Edge and Tom South on the wings, combined with some solid work of Dom Nelson, Tim Clapp and Ron in midfield saw the play work its way more and more towards Stortfords goal. Soon enough the pressure starting telling on the Stortford defence, forcing them to concede a string of short-corners. After a few abortive attempts, a good shot allowed Rob Barton to nip in before anyone else and bag his own rebound-goal. Heartened, the team pushed forward to find an equaliser, but didnt manage to convert anything before half-time. In the second half, a star-cameo of newly promoted Rich Claes injected some more pace and skill into the attack. Nevertheless, it was the visitors again that scored first: a short corner was slickly deflected near the post, leaving both Shahbaz and his defenders flummoxed. But South had found their confidence for a reason and refused to let their heads drop - wave after wave of little green men swarmed into the Stortford half. Again, the pressure told: this time, there was no need for Rob to nudge the ball home, as Colin struck a beautiful dipping shot to pass the goalie. &nbsp;Now, we had the bit between our teeth and went hunting for that equaliser with a vengeance. As even wingbacks Tom Anns and Jan Brynjolffssen ventured into opposition territory, it was only bad luck that kept us from finding the net again. Unfortunately, this also left us more exposed in the back, especially as the midfield started to run out of steam. Once again, the visitors capitalised with a short corner, this time finding just enough room under Shahbazs kickers to slip a ball through and restore their two-goal lead. &nbsp;As the minutes ticked away, it became clear that South lacked the fitness to mount further attacks, even if the will to fight was most certainly still there. To add insult to injury, Stortford felt the need to score one more goal, literally in the last second of the match; although, to be fair to them, it was a beauty of a shot... Although this was not the result, or performance, that we want to see in the league, there are some positives to take home. The team played a lot better than last week and showed some good fighting spirit. Theres still much to improve on - fitness, skills, team play; but the promise is there.</div>","Men's 2nds lose to Stortford 3s","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Guest staring in the sweeper role this week was Ron Oren with Manu Bhardwaj also making a welcome return to the side at short notice at right back despite being slightly worse for wear...
South started the game poorly as a Stortford player was allowed to run through the entire team only to fluff his shot on goal. Unfortunately this let off was not a large enough warning for South as minutes later another player was helped on his way into the D by several South feet to score a simple finish against the exposed keeper. This finally got South fired up for the game and they began to put together some decent moves through the forwards Claes, McCulloch and Johnson.
Once again the home teams short corner defence was unbreakable despite having only 3/5ths of last weeks team. However it was Stortford who scored again after an unmarked player was allowed to stroll into the D and take a shot. Parker was equal to this but it was a Stortford player who reacted to the rebound quickest and he bundled the ball home under little pressure from the South defence.   
South got back into the half as the forward line forced a short corner by continually pressing the Stortford defence. McCulloch injected well and Hawkes played the ball back to McCulloch's favourite spot allowing him to simply sweep it into the goal... or the defender on the lines foot - penalty flick. Chalk eager to make up for his last effort from the spot despatched the stroke as Aston was still trying to convince the captain to promote him to stroke taker. The remaining five minutes of the half were uneventful.
With their captains half time cry of if we can't win this game lets at least get up their arses still ringing in their ears South decided it would be a good idea to win the game. Passes became firmer and straight to sticks and when the ball was turned over a South player was always on hand to hassle their opposite number. This was typified by Virdi, who constricted the play of the opposition like a python every time they came within striking range. Read also made many firm tackles in this period and also found the time to stake a claim to the title of 1st XI aerialist with a couple delightful balls over the top. Hawkes was so inspired he unleashed a training only special and did not shed a single tear as he watched his shiny new ball fly over the back fence after taking a deflection on the way to a sure goal. Unfortunately Stortford got another shot off and whilst Parker was equal to it, the ball  fell to Stortford player once again, 3-1.
This served only to fire up South more and led by telling runs from Hawkes and Virdi they took the game to the opposition once again. Chalk took a blow to the ankle in a battle for the ball in the midfield and from the resultant bully Virdi was able to play the ball back and round so that Claes could make one of his trade-mark mazy runs. After running round the whole of the opponents final quarter he was unceremoniously sandwiched between two players, resulting in a flat Claes and flick number two. Chalk again despatched the stroke. Virdi then nearly made it 3 all when a shimmy took him past a player and allowed him to unleash a thunderous rising shot that their keeper did well to get a glove to. 
South were on the attack again as Johnson slipped it to McCulloch who burst into the D, drew the keeper then squared the ball to the unmarked Chalk who ended up face down on the ground as he was about to apply the finish - stroke number 3? - nope advantage taken! Even as the pitch was cleared of the numerous toys thrown by first McCulloch then Chalk over this decision. Stortford broke again and scored another rebound after Parker made the initial save. The less said about the last few minutes the better as South struggled to find each others sticks and generally gave the ball away to the opponents. This was exemplified when Read was forced to belt the ball past his own post as a safer option than passing to any of his team.
Stortford won a final short and the whistle went. A well executed move lead to the ball been bundled home after the initial shot was once again saved. Hopefully South have got all the sloppy play out of their system and can look forward to the league starting against Ely next week.","Men's 1sts lose to Bishop's Stortford 2nds","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Cancelled trains, family shindigs and Blackpool football club had conspired to keep South to a bare 11, which on a surprisingly warm Sunday afternoon at the Leys meant a tough day ahead. 
The teams guests, Ipswich East Suffolk started the match full of the confidence that comes from sitting top of their respective division. South found themselves penned back in their own half for the first few minutes without reprieve. Fortunately, Ipswich werent able to get a stick on any of the well hit balls into Souths D and eventually the home team managed to get a foothold in the game. Finn Johnson and Nick Bristowe were both very reliable in possession and despite not having too many options to aim for, were able to relieve pressure with some sweetly struck long balls or by simply working the ball across the back four. 
Wearing the clubs new bright yellow away shirts, South should have been able to pick out their teammates easily but too many passes were aimed through an opponents strong side and frequently Souths possession ended abruptly with midfielders, Chalk, Pearson and Williams having to scamper back to help the back four tidy up after a sloppy error. Ipswichs basic skills were far too good throughout the side for South to get away with not passing accurately and eventually the team took the hint and raised their game. 
South were looking good down the right with Ron Oren linking well with Russell Johnson and when the ball was then moved back into the middle to Chalk and Williams, South were able to penetrate the D. Rob Barton, Pearson and Ali Ward all had half chances snuffed out by the committed Ipswich backline but there were enough chances created for South to have taken the lead despite Ipswich shading the possession pie chart. Courtesy of some increasingly wild challenges in their own 25 South began to concede a few short corners and shortly before half time one was converted with a low drive beating Shahbaz Ali in goal. 
Disappointed but not disheartened South regrouped at half time and came out with all guns blazing in the second period. Asserting their authority in midfield, South threatened the Ipswich D consistently during the early exchanges but failed to register a solid chance on goal despite winning their first short corner of the game. South started to win the 50:50 challenges and at times it looked like a more physical approach might pay dividends. After a physical but scruffy challenge on Ipswichs right back Williams was called over to the Umpire and immediately shown a straight red card. Fortunately the umpire in question had picked the wrong colour from his deck and it was immediately downgraded to a green, much to Souths relief. 
As the half progressed Ipswich regained their involvement in the match and looked increasingly dangerous on the break, forcing Souths players to work hard to track back and shut out the danger. This obviously started to take its toll on Souths players as they began to tire. At this stage a couple of substitutes would have been warmly welcomed, there were none and South deserve great credit for their work rate under increasing pressure. Rather than wilting, South found a second wind and created their best two chances of the match, first Williams played Russell Johnson in, who was first unlucky to see his touch saved and then doubly unlucky to be wiped out by the keeper for his troubles. Shortly afterwards Johnson had his revenge as he motored down the right, along the baseline and into the D. His pass was controlled by Chalk whose trademark spin and shot worked yet again and the ball crashed against the backboard.
Two yellow cards, one for either side reduced the game to 10v10. Souths recipient, Bristowe should count himself unlucky, after a harsh umpires decision went against him, the whole team shared his frustration. Throwing ones stick however is apparently a straight yellow and the Brizzle was gone! 
The final minutes of the match belonged to the away side who saw a succession of short corners saved by the excellent Ali or shut down by runners Dave Aston and Finn Johnson. For their hard work and commitment to the cause South thoroughly deserved the draw and had it been a league fixture, the team would have been delighted. Unfortunately South faced the hardship of Extra Time, the first period of which started as regular time had ended with Ipswich putting pressure on the South defence and winning a series of shorts. Unfortunately the writing was on the wall for South, as the pressure mounted it seemed inevitable that eventually Ipswich would break through. 
And so it was that for the second season in a row South succumbed to a cruel Golden Goal that perhaps doesnt give the team the credit they deserve for the progress they have made in the past couple of years. Maybe next year will be different?","Men's 1sts lose narrowly to Ipswich - East Suffolk","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

The previous week had provided a fairly gentle re-introduction as South faced Shefford & Sandys youth development team. Leadenham, who sat in third place in the northern section of Division 6NW, parallel with the 3rds, would prove a very different kettle of fish.
The enthusiasm of both squads for the game was evident in the number of players who turned up. South, due to a counting mishap by General Jelley (or was it his logistical staff?) had troops coming out of their ears: seventeen eventually showed, although one player agreed to a late-notice switch to help out the 4ths who had picked up a couple of injuries, to leave Herr Kommandant marshalling sixteen. Leadenham themselves brought a squad of fourteen which included a decent balance of older teenagers and adults.
The game began with the ball swinging end-to-end. Souths midfield were attempting to impose the level of dominance they have often achieved in league games, joining in with the attack wherever possible. Leadenham for their part played with their forwards pretty high and a midfield pushing on from deep so that, when they attacked, the South backline were often out-numbered. As a result, the game was quite open.
Despite the willingness of the Leadenham attack it was the visitors' keeper, rather than Chris C in the South goal, who was doing the majority of the work. South fashioned a number of chances in the opening half but couldnt find the finishing touch. Slightly concerningly, for the second week in a row the short corners were showing significant hiccoughs, most routines breaking down without a shot even being attempted. Must do better is the message to all concerned.
South made the breakthrough in the second half. From a sideline in their own half, the back option to a supporting player was taken and crucially was taken early. This drew the Leadenham midfield upfield in an attempt to press and allowed the ball to be slipped out to Stu, wide right, with space in front of him to attack. Stu advanced towards the full-back, forcing him to engage, then slipped a pass to Rupert who now had a clear run to the goalline. Rupert took advantage to push into the circle and picked the right pass when pulling the ball back to the penalty spot, where Tim was arriving late to sweep into the far corner. A very good goal, and a prime example of going backwards to go forwards.
From that point, Souths control of the match increased as the visitors' midfield was worn down by the defensive work required, and so unable to support their forwards as well as before. South's short corners were still malfunctioning though, so the score remained at 1-0 at the final whistle.
In many ways, this was a useful outing for the 3rds. With the key matches of the season against Newmarket and St Neots 4ths coming up in the next two weeks and no competitive action since January, a close match against an evenly matched side was precisely what was called for. Before Christmas the 3rds had failed to raise teams for the friendly matches arrange to fill the fixture gap before meeting our promotion rivals and had subsequently slipped to two costly defeats. This time around the team has prepared properly so lets hope we see the fruits of that in what may prove a defining period of the season.","Men's 3rds beat Leadenham in a friendly","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

The previous week's double victory had also tied the club winning streak record with the 2nds' 11-game run to gain promotion last season.
With the lowest number of goals conceded by any men's team over a league season - a mere 12 in 17 games to date - up for grabs was the club clean sheet tally. The team had already secured the record for league shut-outs in a season with 8 and were tied overall with 10 shut-outs, equalling the 2nds from 2007/08 (where 4 of theirs came in friendlies). Finally, the men's goal difference record stood with the 1sts from their Div 4 promotion campaign in 2005/06, finishing on +58. Starting the day on +54, this was also tantalisingly within reach.
Perhaps the blizzard of statistics had befuddled the 3s' usually keenly-focused minds. Or maybe it was the spring sunshine and pre-match team photos lending a decidedly end-of-season feel to the much-delayed derby match. Whatever it was, from the push back South were quickly into the 4s' D hunting for their needed goals. In fact, so cavalier was the attacking verve that even JB was sweeping on the 25 yard line - theirs!
The perils of this strategy were illustrated almost immediately. Blessed with powerful hitters in Dave Monck and James Siddorns and willing running up front from Jacob Van de Moortel and Boris Lossy, the unfancied 4s quickly turned defence into attack, breaking into the 3s' D as the defence bumbled around and the midfield jogged amiably back. Before you could say ""cocky overconfidence"" the ball had ricocheted around the D as the defence failed to clear its lines finishing with Simon Frampton touching it into the back of the net. The 4s were elated, the 3s dumbfounded and the season clean sheet record out of sight almost before the starting whistle had faded. Echoes of San Marino-England reverberated around the pitch.
Within minutes, things were worse as Goal-a-Game took a strike full on his dodgy ankle. The tumble and roll was quite spectacular, a full 8 revolutions before coming to a halt. Indeed, at one point we thought John was trying to reach the sideline some 20 yards away. As he limped off the pitch, the 3s' chances of Goal King were suddenly looking very dubious as well.
Fortunately, the unexpected reverses served to shake the 3s out of any post-season reverie they may have been in. Attention was refocused, discipline reapplied and the 3s began working to get themselves back into the game. The equaliser came from a scrappy effort that fell first to Tim Clapp, now playing at centre forward, who hacked away like a demented and rather uncoordinated woodchopper as he attempted to get a shot past Shahzad before Ali Edge finally tapped the loose ball in from just outside the right post. Shortly afterwards the 3s took the lead, another unlovely effort this time finished by Tim after great work down the right from full back Nick Greaves, his repeated threatening forays one of the few fragrant roses on the dung heap of the 3s' first half performance.
Still the 3s were finding it difficult to nullify the 4s' attacking threat though. Their 4-4-2 formation led to the 3s being overloaded as first Simon and then Neil at left back were frequently faced with both Boris and Jacob. The 3s were strong in midfield with Matt, Tom South and Stu Creed but the 4s were content to concede a lot of ball and rely on their strong hitting from deep to launch attacks, the 3s allowing themselves to get drawn too far up the pitch with the obvious danger. Too often across the team there was confusion about who should be where, epitomised when both Tom and Stu headed towards a loose ball, only to simultaneously veer away from it as communication broke down completely, presenting it to a grateful opposition.
Despite this, the 3s secured a third goal before half time. The move originated in a delightful pass from Matt Kern in possession, playing a visionary ball through a gap in the midfield down the left hand channel for Ali who crossed for a typically cultured finish from Rupert at the far post. Having already lost their centre-forward, Stu Creed was laid out on the floor by a robust challenge from the Monckosaurus but fortunately the injury proved to be nothing worse than a jarred nerve. By the interval, Creed and Sniffer had both recovered sufficiently to rejoin the fray and the 3s came out with renowned determination.
An early fourth goal seemed to bode well, this time Tom turning on the edge of the D to make space before pushing his shot into the far corner. The 4s weren't going to be turned over though and continued to test the league champions. Several times Chris Collinson was called into action and, having won several short corners, the 4s' best chance of a second was only denied by first a save from Chris followed by a block on the line from Paul South. At the other end, the 3s' usually reliable short corner routines had descended into complete farce with wayward injections, failures to back up, and confusion between stopper and striker all meaning the 3s were struggling to even get the ball back into the D let alone get a shot on goal. Jan, come back, we miss you!
Entering the final quarter, it became apparent it would take something special if the 3s were going to get their 5-goal margin. Fortunately, cometh the hour cometh the man and in this case, that man was Tim. First a spectacular strike from a tight angle on the right beat Shahzad. With minutes running out, a tiring 4s defence was finally opened up with a through ball which put Tim clean through on the keeper. His first shot was saved but fortunately he picked up the rebound to lift it over the keeper and into the goal for his hatrick.
The whistle went as the 4s won one final short corner, pulling everyone up but failing to crack the 3s' determination to hang on to their record goal difference. Not a vintage performance from the 3s but credit goes to the 4s for a display that has come on leaps and bounds from the teams' first meeting at the start of the season. Had missing stars Phil Harvey and Ian Marshman been available as well, the result could have been decidedly hairy for the higher team.
With both teams feasting on Jake Davis's home-made cup cakes and captain Jelley's sparkling fizz, news came through that Graham had snatched the Goal Kings title with a final-game hatrick to pip both Jack and John. Still, a club record twelfth victory on the trot took the edge off the disappointment and the team look forward to next season back in Division 5NW at the first time of asking.

But before Spurs met Chelsea, there was the small matter of Cambridge South vs Wisbech 3rds.   A win for South would confirm 4th spot, and put them on their way to their best ever points tally.   A win for Wisbech would keep them 6th, a loss would......keep them 6th.
Somehow, despite this knife-edge backdrop to the game, both sides started sluggishly, South so much so that you could be forgiven for thinking it was Nick Bristowe commanding things from the back and not the powerhouse that is Chris Graveling.   The one player that did up his game though was Chalk, sniffing out a bobbled goal to draw level with McCulloch in the goal kings stakes.
Not to be outdone, Wiz meandered forward to win back a short corner.   A swift routine (you could forgive us for thinking they had taken lessons off Peterborough) was despatched into the bottom left. 1-1.
At half time McCulloch tried desparately to rally the troops- and boy it worked.   A goalmouth scramble was despatched by Mark Williams to draw him within 10 goals of John Greaves in the top goalscorer stakes.
And then, Average took the game by the scruff of the neck.   By this I mean he hit the ball in the vague direction of the goal.   The chance looked to have been snuffed out as McCulloch deflected it carelessly [some would even say selfishly] wide of the goal- however Chalk was thankfully on hand to clear up the mess and nail it into the bottom corner for 3-1.
With Hawkes having another non-event of a performance in midfield, it was left to Bhav good game Virdi to put the final gloss on the game for 4-1.  To be honest, by this point I was more worried about not getting sunstroke, but Im sure it was a great goal- his strikes are normally worth waiting for!   A final win against Rutland would put South on 46 points, a best ever total, which sadly would have been good enough for promotion in most NW leagues, but not this one.","Men's 1sts beat Wisbech Town 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

A win would practically assure Cambridge South 3rds of the division title, securing promotion and becoming the first South men's team on records (i.e. since before 1999) to win a division title.
St Neots's youth development team revealed an average age several years older than the neophytes who had faced South in the reverse fixture before Christmas. Allied with a few older heads, it was clear they were a side capable of giving South a stern test. Despite being shorn of several regulars - David Doup, Stu Creed, Tim Clapp and Laurie Haslop all missing - South were still able to field a strong line-up, a tribute to the squad's increasing strength in depth. At the back, South welcomed the return of Jim Thorpe, his recent half-marathon achievement showing there's life in the old dog yet.
It was a warm spring morning at The Leys as St Neots pushed back. True to expectations, St Neots were competing well but South early on began to look the more dangerous side. Balls were being moved forward quickly and Rupert Espley on the right wing was making particular inroads, several times reaching the byline to crack crosses into the D. St Neots's threat was mainly coming on the break, relying on their young legs to cover the ground but rarely able to create a clear chance.
As the half wore on and chances came and went for South, it began to feel like it might be one of those days where the ball just refuses to go in. The best chance before the break fell to Ali Edge, arriving at the left post unmarked as the ball was crossed in but just failing to make a clean connection. More comical was Olly Lamming's raised strike on the half volley, unfortunately wide of the goal and after the whistle had already gone but which nevertheless came close to mowing down several St Neots defenders. Down the other end, one St Neot's break saw the ball knocked beyond the last defender only for Neil Sneade to come across from right back and calmly collect the ball before the St Neots forward could latch on to it.
At half time the game was still goalless but captain Jelley was confident that refusing to be panicked and continuing to play their game would eventually bring South rewards. The skipper's words were proved prophetic quicker than he could have imagined. From the push back, South attacked and quickly won a short corner. The ball was injected to Tom South who dragged the ball and flicked it into the far corner low to the keeper's left to open the scoring. Buoyed by the breakthrough, South kicked on and began to regularly threaten the St Neots goal, forcing the keeper into a number of saves. Tom was excelling in his runs from midfield, one slaloming effort taking him through practically the whole St Neots defence before his shot went just wide.
A one goal lead was far from comfortable though. Although St Neots were finding it hard to create clear goalscoring chances, they succeeding in winning several short corners, one of which drew a good low save from Steve Parker in the South goal and several of which had to be cleared with alacrity. Jim showed flashes of the old class to frustrate several dangerous attacks and launch shrewd counters, including one surging run that took him to the edge of the opposition D. Meanwhile, John Benedikz was sweeping to mop up any danger and using his strong hits to clear the lines.
As the game entered the final quarter, South at last put clear water between themselves and their opponents. This time Ali, atoning for his earlier missed opportunity, saw his close range shot saved but was quickest to react and put the ball home at the second attempt. A few minutes later, Goal-a-Game found his narrow-angled shot from close to the left byline blocked as he was bundled over. Nonetheless, he managed to play the ball across the goal as the umpires played advantage, to leave Ali with a simple reverse stick tap in from a couple of feet out.
The game secured, South safely saw out the remaining minutes. The win leaves South needing two points from their final two fixtures to secure the title, with an opportunity to make it safe tomorrow against March before the season-ending derby with the 4ths next weekend.","Men's 3rds beat St Neots 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",

Assembling at Milton Park & Ride on a cold and slightly hazy spring morning, the day got off to an inauspicious start when a call to laggard Tristen Knight elicited a mumbled confession that he hadnt realised he was in the squad and was still in bed in Saffron Walden.
Undaunted, the remaining thirteen headed off in convoy into the fenland mists. The journey was enlivened only by Stu Creeds attempt to overtake a lorry, pulling out into the offside lane and going precisely nowhere as he proved that a fully-laden Skoda Fabia doesnt accelerate well in top gear. While the rest of the team following behind looked on at this impromptu game of chicken, Stu finally changed down and floored the throttle to slowly creep past the juggernaut.
All players having made it safely to the pitch, the contrast from the Leys surface the day before could hardly have been greater. The March surface was covered in more sand than a Costa Blanca beach. As balls help up or dropped dead on the mini-dunes covering the pitch, it was apparent that this would not be a day for long cross-pitch passes.
Ready and raring to go, from the push back South were straight on the attack, forcing March on to the back foot as the home side struggled to get over the half way line. The rewards werent long in coming as Rupert Espley worked an opening in a crowded D to open the scoring with barely five minutes on the clock. From the restart, South immediately had their opponents backpedalling again, this time David Doup latching on to a loose ball to rapidly bring up the second goal.
As if to reflect Souths mood, the cool morning mist that had shaded the pitch finally burnt away to bathe the game in sunshine. South continued to dominate the play, Matt Kern, Ali Edge and Stu controlling possession in midfield with Rupert and David playing crosses towards John Greaves in the centre, requiring numerous saving tackles and interceptions from the March defence to preserve their goal.
March were threatening only rarely, principally on the break, but the South defence were seldom troubled. John Benedikz sweeping and Neil Sneade at centre back were able to take it in turns to step up and support the attack. Out wide, captain Jelley was doing a solid job containing Marchs most able players down Souths left flank while his opposite number Nick Greaves was making great overlapping runs forward from right back.
The match then settled into a pattern, with South controlling the play and creating numerous chances but, after their early success, frustratingly unable to build on their lead. Credit went to the March keeper who made numerous determined saves, while Steve Parker down the opposite end was looking decidedly more relaxed. Half time was reached with no change to the score.
The second period resumed much as the first had left off, with the ball stubbornly refusing to go into the March goal as a combination of blocks, saves and misses frustrated the visitors. Particular noteworthy was Ruperts spectacular attempt at a reverse stick strike on the run, the ball skewing off in completely the opposite direction and posing more of a threat to passing seagulls than the March goal as it soared towards the corner flag.
After 40 minutes of frustration, the dam finally broke when David nicked in front of another goalmouth melee to flick the ball over the prone keeper with his reverse stick. The third goal and the warm weather seemed to finally crack Marchs resolve as Souths game came together. The fourth goal followed swiftly from an end to end move. Marchs left winger chased a long ball and just succeeding in keeping it from going over Souths backline only for Neil to promptly take it off him, carrying it towards the halfway line before releasing Nick beyond the March covering midfielder. His surge down the wing ended with a rapidly-taken corner which was played into the D where Goal-a-Game hit an early first time strike to beat the keeper before he had time to set himself.
A fifth goal soon came from a South short corner routine, JB opting for a straight strike from right to left across the keeper through a gap in the outrushing defence. The half-dozen was a well worked move, a corner on the right being shipped back by Matt to Neil, arriving at the top of the 25, who promptly switched it across to JB on the left of the D, he in turn slipping the ball to Tom running in from near the left byline who jinked past a defender before placing his shot home.
The goal glut was topped off with a final late strike for David, completing a well-deserved hatrick with a few minutes left on the clock. The whistle went to confirm Souths division championship in fine style. The final weekends derby match with South 4s will be a celebratory affair for Souths first mens league title on record.","Men's 3rds smash March Town 4 to seal Champion's spot in the Division","False","False",0,1,"True","False",
1312,"31/03/2012","League",1,102,"12:00",3,"Away","4","0","3","0","False","False","False","For the final game the season South Mens 1st XI travelled to Rutland to take on their already relegated 2nd team. With several key team members and Nick Bristowe unavailable we had only 11 players available so it was a good job that Jack managed to find Tom Watson for the meet, scrape him off the pavement and pour him into the car to sober up on the journey.
The captains positional selection was illuminating. Some might question his motives in putting Chalk (his closest rival for top-scorer of the season) into a right-back position. Not me, I never doubted that this was based on anything other than sound team principles. Nothing to do with Goal Kings. Nope. Definitely not. 
As the teams lined up it was Rutland who looked the more impressive, packed with fresh-faced youth and exuberance. True, South did have a couple of players under 25 but neither were an advertisement for clean living - Watson, with eyes like two p*ss holes in the snow and a tongue that seemed to be wearing a yellow sock and Johnson (F), unshaven in his 3 week old unwashed kit, looking and smelling like a tramp. We were a little concerned that we might be faced with a lot of pace and skill.
However, looks can be deceiving and, although Rutland did have some good individual players they did not play together as a team and South were dominant throughout the match. As always, I dont remember a great deal about the goals we scored. Goal scoring is for the flash Harrys who play up front, all mouth and no trousers. For any serious commentator, the beauty of hockey is in the defence - thats where you see the cut and thrust of the game, the battle of wits, pace and agility. Really Im not sure why I write these reports. Still, here goes .
We got the first goal after 10 minutes or so from an open play move which may well have been up the right hand side through Johnson (R). I think that a cross came in from outside the D but maybe it was pulled back from the byline. Anyway, McCulloch was on hand to deflect the ball into the goal.
At this point we noticed that we were only playing with 10 men. Venner had done a Bristowe and limped off after 5 minutes and was now crouched almost out of sight behind the spare goal on the sideline and appeared to be massaging himself vigorously. Not quite sure what was happening but it looked damn suspicious to me. Still it clearly worked for him as he came back on in a few minutes with a renewed spring in his step.
So, back to the game. On about 15 minutes we won our first short corner. I expect that Venner won it for us but it could have been someone else. Be that as it may, we scored from it but from my position on the half-way line it looked like a pretty soft goal. Ill admit that it was a good push out by McCulloch and stop by Chalk but then Hawkess push travelled back to the injector slower than a tortoise with a hangover and should have been cut out by the home defence. It wasnt and Graham chipped it into the goal for his second of the day and to take the lead in the Goal Kings competition.
Not long after that we won a second short corner from which we also scored - Hawkes playing a delightfully disguised slow drag flick which deceived everyone and found the back of the net. Or in other words he fluffed the flick and the ball looped up and fell into the goal.
Three-nil up at half time and all fairly comfortable although South hadnt had it all their own way and it was no time to be complacent. Rutland came out in the second half with much more determination and put some concerted pressure on the South goal. However, the defence stood firm and with Parker on great form as always they never really looked like conceding. And then midway through the half South put the game to bed with a really good 4th goal. Starting from the back it took only 3 touches - Wych to Williams, Williams to Venner and Venner to McCulloch - to move the ball all the way from our own goal-line into the opposition D and then McCulloch scored with an excellent reverse strike to claim his hat-trick.
With the game sewn up it was time for a slight change and the skipper switched Watson into right back and moved Chalk up into midfield. Some might say that, with the Goal Kings tied up, Graham was making an empty gesture to Jack but not me. No way. It was a well-considered tactical move designed solely for the good of the team. It did have the result that it brought Watson into contact with the rather chippy Rutland midfielder (you know, the one with a face that looks like hes looking at himself in the back of a spoon). Well, as we know, Watson may be small but he doesnt get pushed around so inevitably when the Rutland player had a dig it ended up with handbags being thrown. Fortunately Williams was on hand - immediately clucking round Watson like a protective mother hen and accusing the opposition player of being naughty. I dont know if youve heard Mark telling off the opposition in a match but he does it in such a fatherly way that Im sure they leave feeling thoroughly ashamed of themselves. Honestly, it was heart-warming to watch and if you get the chance at the Annual Dinner you should get him to tell you about it.
The game was then played out mostly in the Rutland half without too much excitement until South won a short corner and the final whistle went. The skipper very kindly agreed to allow Wych to take first strike of the short to keep up his average of one shot on goal per season. This then hit a defenders foot leading to another short and this time Aston was given a turn but he inexplicably decided to take the ball before it reached the stopper and made a right hash of it, leading to a free hit to Rutland and the end of the game. This incident quite took the gloss off the victory and pretty much ruined the game for most of us. Still, theres always hope that Aston will be playing 2s next year.
So the M1 season came to end and in summary it was pretty much the story of Astons life; a promising start with high hopes then letting itself down in mid-season followed by a general sense of disappointment and underachievement at the end. 
See you all next season.

Cambridge South 2s for whom a win would remove the faint mathematical chance of relegation faced an Ely side positioned comfortably mid-table with little but pride to play for. With the 2s Captain swanning off to Holland and the students away for Easter there was the welcome return of some old familiars to the team with Andy and Bhav and some fresh young eagerness in Laurie facing his old club.
 The twos performances this season have been characterized by an ability to compete with or beat the teams just above them in the league but struggle against those below. And so it was to prove again. After captain on the day Tom's rather more gentle warm up (""We aren't going to sprint it just tires me out pregame"") battle was commenced in nigh on perfect hockey conditions.
The early exchanges were rather end to end with flurries from South down the wings and some sharp break outs from Ely that had the home side scuttling back. It quickly became clear that the biggest danger to the hosts was the sheer pace of the Ely frontman who could out-sprint any of the back four if given space to do so. Tenacious marking from Andy combined with Paresh's usual ability to stop any attack dead on his stick meant that this space generally wasn't available.
It was the home side who first broke the deadlock when, having been awarded a short, the slightly off target injection was adjusted to by Bhav who took two steps to his right and lasered the ball into the bottom left hand corner.
Never one to give up, Rob then decided to start a late charge for goal kings (knowing he was only six behind) and finding himself one on one with the Ely keeper calmly slotted the ball below the diving player to make to 2-0 to the hosts at half time.
The second half Ely attacks became more concerted resulting in a few short corners and one clearance off the line for South but simultaneously they apparently decided to play without a left wing or left half leaving areas of space reminiscent of the American Prairies for Dom, Chris P and Ian to attack on the right hand side cheered on by a growing crowd of Men's 3s and 4s. So of course the goal was scored by our inside left; Laurie obtained bragging rights over his old team mates by toe poking it past the keeper with just enough force to dribble over the line before the nearest defender could reach it.
And so was survival guaranteed in Div 3. With 4 wins against teams that finished above us in the table and the ability to push even the top teams close on our day we clearly belong, but a record of 4 draws and a solitary win in six games against the three sides below us show that could have been a much more comfortable season. Hone the killer instinct against worse teams (see above), score more goals (flat last), develop more consistency (cf. early season vs Wisbech 2 and Peterborough) and aim for a top six finish next season.

This year the L1s can choose from a whole team of midfield players with just one committed striker and one defender starting the match this week.  This didn't hold the team back in the first half, with sterling performances from Cath, Kat and Naomi in defence, a man of the match winning show of skill and tactical play from Anne sweeping in front of the defence, and some great possession play in midfield and attack.  Together, that led to South dominating the game with persistent pressure within the 25 not being converted (sadly, and all too commonly for us) into actual goals.  Alice's goal came from a well worked short corner routine with Lindsey feeding a great ball from right slip.  In contrast, the single first half goal from Rutland trickled over the line after a lucky break.  After such success, South should have dominated in the second half but the combined effect of Rutland's players moving up a gear, our team getting tired and scrappy and an impressive hattrick-scoring performance from the sole Rutland scorer meant we ended up with a score line that didn't really reflect the quality of South's play.  Even so, a creditable performance against one of the best drilled teams in the league and we are confident that when our vice captain Lou returns to the back line (from Africa!) and we get a more settled team.

Alice Hug scored from just within the circle from a reverse-stick to score the first goal of the game within 90 seconds. After some great mid-field play and attacks on goal, Souths won their first short-corner to score again. Receiver Alice passed off to Lyndsey on her right, and after a short struggle Bex tapped it into left post. Although we attacked for most of the game, the opposition did manage a break in the first half, to score off a text book short-corner that could not have been defended to bring the score to 2:1. 
Souths were determined not to let their lead drop, and Georgie (third member of the crack striker line-up) was not prepared to let Bex and Alice have all the glory. She again drove the ball into the circle, with a lay off to Bex. The pass came back to Alice on left post, a bouncy ball, but Alice managed to get her stick on it for a beautifully raised ball into the back top of the net. The opposition regained some ground and after some focus in our defence, with Loopy staving off a number of 1-on-1s while the back line got back to goal. Georgie nabbed it on the defensive 25 to drive up the full length of the pitch. Another lay off to Alice on the left, and a pass to Bex who literally dribbled it over the goal line for the fourth goal. The opposition broke again with speed to score again, but in the closing minutes Souths cemented their lead with Bex having a strike on goal. First attempt wasn't quite there, but once Bex scooted around the goalie and had a little tussle with the oppositions final defender, she again pushed it right over the line for our fifth goal. It's obviously been hard not to dwell on our 2 goal scorers in this match report, but they wouldn't have had the opportunity without some brilliant passing and mid-field play and solid defence who mostly kept the ball in the attacking half.

Well, almost - with a certain ageing forward complaining about a hangover (from one glass of
wine) at 3.30 in the afternoon. The game started brightly, with South holding onto most of the possession for the first twenty minutes, and with several strong attacks leading to two coming off the post in five minutes with our forward trio of Hug, Hurford and Baker looking dangerous and constantly causing problems for the Spalding defence.
They were supported by an industrious midfield combination of Dee, Dent, Penfold and Beasley, who kept the pressure on and the action in the opposition half. Spalding made a couple of breaks but the defence of Raffan, Benedikz and Cantwell held fast - Lou the flying lemon
Tonkin making two dramatic saves to keep the score-line favourable.
The goal was coming, and the patience paid off. The move starting with a classic mazy run from Beasley confounding the defence, a lay off to Hug allowed her to unleash one of the blistering shots we have come to expect from the whippersnapper up front and we went into half time one nil up.
When the whistle blew for half-time, South looked inexplicably despondent - a mood which soon lifted when we realised we were ahead and frustrated at the number of near misses rather than anything actually being wrong. We didnt come to rue the chances missed in the first half, however, and a well-worked penalty corner was put away with pinpoint accuracy for Hugs second. Berends searching through balls gave the irrepressible Bex Duracell Bunny (the Umpires
description) Baker opportunities to drive deep behind the opposition defence and along the backline. The third goal came as the ball was driven up the pitch by Penfold, and a sharp one-two between with Hurford gave Hug her hat-trick goal. As the game came to a close, Raffan made some storming attacking runs from deep to join the waves of attack which drew a further penalty corner. Four ricochets around the D sent the ball to Beasley on the post who tapped it past the keeper to seal the result. A great performance from the South team, bolstered by fantastic support (of all-ages) from the sidelines. Only disappointment was that Hug never got her hat-trick round in at the pub.","Ladies' 1sts beat Spalding Ladies 2s","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Going into the match we were level on both points and goal difference - our marginally superior goals for putting us just ahead in the mid-table doldrums of the Cambs Premier League.
The day started with a bit of a shock to the system - with the ever-punctual Anne Horan not actually being the last to arrive, though this was probably unintentional given Beasleys detour across Cambridge via The Abbey. Muppet.  Moving on - the warm up was uneventful, apart from some illuminating discussion of Cambridges mole population. Hug actually joined in too - which was a nice surprise...
South started the game brightly, with some good moves leading to some early shots on the St Ives goal which we were unlucky not to convert. The defensive formation looked impressively solid, with Dabb, Raffan and newbie Brady putting in some strong tackles and moving the ball up to the midfield efficiently, (as well as around the back on occasion!). Anne Horan had a cracking game in the pivotal role of anchor (NOT SWEEPER!) - and was a worthy winner for Man of the Match, and deserves recognition for her vocal intimidation tactics in particular. The midfield trio of Beasley, Blumlein and Dee worked tirelessly to provide opportunities for the attacking combination of Hug, Baker and Hurford who looked dangerous - Baker again working her way in behind the defence and causing problems. Hug and Hurford linked up well and after several promising attacks, an illegal block on the line afforded us a flick. Hug converted brilliantly with a clinical attempt that flew past the keeper into the corner. (Whilst this was undoubtedly in the best interests of the game, Hug could have saved the rest of us from another week of Hurfords misplaced pent-up goal frustration...)
The second half started in the same vein as the first had ended, with several well-worked moves looking dangerous but ultimately fruitless - much to the disappointment of the vocal and entertaining battalion of support on the sidelines. A game of foul bingo provided a win for Nick Venner - whose oracle-like predictions of who would commit which indiscretion was alarmingly accurate. Not that pairing Hurford and dissent was a particularly difficult call to make. The defence looked strong, but an unlucky deflection saw us concede mid way through. South immediately launched a strong attack, which ended with an own-goal being awarded, and then immediately revoked, much to the disappointment of the sideline talent (bolstered by the arrival of the Schneade...)
Both teams tired going into the last 15, but South withstood a series of penalty corners - the un-sighted Loopy putting in an Olympic-worthy save to keep the score-line level. As with out last match - the support from the sideline made a real difference. We were unlucky not to win, but it was a strong performance from the South team.
<h2>L1's bingo match report</h2>
<strong>Hockey Foul Bingo</strong> - the rules are simple. Pick 6 players and 6 offences, if your player commits your offence and is blown up for it by an umpire (or the majority of the crowd, lets be fair they cannot see everything) you cross it off. 1st one to cross of all 6 wins. We had 3 players today and here are their selections.

The game started and immediately a box was ticked, Alice celebrating a successful push back by letting go of a huge greenie onto the pitch. South started off dominant and it was looking like this could be the only mark of the game. It's hard to commit fouls when you always have the ball. The only downside was Cantwell had to leave the pitch robbing South not only an excellent player but a combative spirit as well. This pressure was not however converted into many goal scoring chances which allowed St Ives to get back into the game. A stick tackle from Raffen and some pushing from Dabb kept the game interesting for the spectators and as the half came into its final 10 minutes a body on the line stopped a clear South goal. It would be really embarrassing to miss a penalty flick so it's a good job Alice using her nerves of steel placed the ball just over the back board to the keepers left. St Ives tried to rally but a well timed Raffen foot cut out one attack and a Beasley stick tackle another. Alice was also ruled to be only 4.99 m from a free hit and with that the half time whistle went.

Nick was excited about his lead and confident that he could win this tense game. Russ however was beginning to feel that the heated contest he felt would ensure might not materialise and he might not be ticking any more boxes.
Cantwell also felt well enough to march over to the team talk and give her own analysis of the game so far (stop acting like girls and man up).
The second half started with all still to play for, when 3 minutes and 49 seconds into the half Nick saw a sight he thought he would never see. Down the left wing their the unmistakable shape of Alice could be seen moving at a higher than usual speed. Nick immediately pulled out his trig tables, sextant and hand held anemometer and began frivolously calculating, judging by the ponytail drag angle he calculated a new record speed of 3 knots had been achieved. South were clearly inspired by this effort and began to produce numerous chances. A great move starting at the back through Georgie in middle found Baker through on goal. However the recovering defence manage to get a stick in to play the ball onto her foot to level the important score at 3-3. Several shorts soon followed but despite some great strikes the back of the net could not be found. Then disaster struck a St Ives break away led to a forward being one on one with Loopy in the goal and allowed them to lift the ball over her outstretched leg to level the scores against the run of play. South unfortunately let this get to them and this allowed Russ to get back in the game with a small shower of verbels from the South captain. Cantwell had had enough and with no regard to her own safety subbed herself back on. This interjection along with the hard working and tough tackling Ann steadied the shape as the game went into the tense last 10 minutes with Jack and Nick still level. Nick and Russ had thought themselves to be really quite clever by selecting Loopy to kick the ball. I had more faith in the ability of the L1's and said she would not get a touch all game. I was therefore heart broken in the the last 4 minutes to see her kick clear to win the game. Their was one more incident before full time was blown CENSORED ..... TOO CONTROVERSIAL .... THIS IS A FAMILY WEBSITE but seriously Raikes I know it says liability on your shirt for a reason - how did you not see that!

We all thought foul bingo was a great successful and it will be coming to more matches in the future. Unfortunately Nick came away with the chocolate digestive prize he provided himself this time and the bragging rights he awarded himself at least until Alice reads this ... The L1's played well but next week score some more goals please.

Although we've had some severe losses to Newmarket previously, we went out strong and with expectations it was anyone's game. It was clear from the start we were going to have to play defensively, and the mids and forwards were going to have work extra hard to come back and support the defence, which they did admirably. Marking was tight as it could be considering we (I'll put my hand up here) were perhaps not as fit as our opposition. However, with remarkably accurate tackles in the defensive D and some amazing saves by Loopy, we managed to keep their goal count to 1 in the first half, even though we didn't get many a breaks into our attacking 50 yards. Some great passing and team work by the forwards led to a goal from Bex to even the score 1:1 at half time.
The second half saw Newmarket pick up their accuracy in attack, with a number of goals that were clean and almost unstoppable. The score line doesn't give justice to the number of saves by Loopy and Ellie/Amanda/Lou C/Naomi (from mid-air!) on the back line. Although with a rocking goal from Alice saw us score again, it was a clear win by the opposition. We played well, worked well as a team, the forwards had an excellent conversion rate of goals to time spend in our attacking D, but on the day were beaten by a stronger side.

With the men having a morning off, the really important business of Foul Bingo was again fiercely contested on the sidelines by the teams most hardcore of fans.
We started strongly, with our midfield and forward combinations putting the Wisbech defence under a lot of pressure and the ball pinging about all over the place in cross-field switches which made for some exciting plays. With the team working really hard for each other, there were some awesome passing moves. Just before half time, the pressure paid off.  Beasleys lightning dash from left midfield got behind the first line of defence, and the perfectly weighted pass found Dee in front of the keeper. Some slick stick work and an even slicker turn left the keeper helpless, and Dee put South ahead going into half time.
Wisbech came at us strongly in the second half, but the midfield and defence coped well under the pressure and successfully defended a series of penalty corners to keep the narrow lead. One penalty corner however proved too much and the scores were levelled. Late in the second half, an unavoidable foot on the line resulted in a penalty flick being awarded. Penfold, who deserves a special mention for taking one for the team (literally) and volunteering to go in goal with Loopy away for the weekend, stood up to the pressure and made an incredible save to keep us in the game. 1-1 was a fair result with a solid performance from South, especially in the first half, against a strong Wisbech team who are the current league leaders.","Ladies' 1sts draw against Wisbech Town Ladies 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

After a long, sat-nav defeating drive up to Spalding, we rediscovered exactly why playing hockey is fun, as the pitch was bathed in golden sunshine - a welcome change from the last few weeks! With a busy weekend, we had only 11 players and, as expected, it proved to be a punishing match. It was end to end stuff, and South battled really hard to break down the Spalding moves deep inside their own half. This approach worked well, and some great passing resulted in a series of attacks in the Spalding D. A great goal from Hug put us 1-0 up going into half time. The second half was as intense as the first, and unluckily made all the more so by a couple of injuries that forced a couple of players off the pitch for some time. However, South worked really hard, and some great interplay between the midfielders and fowards kept us camped again in the Spalding half. A great backline effort from Liles resulted in a second goal for Hug, and a cushion we were all grateful for. Spalding got one back from a well-converted penalty corner, but South played out the match to grab a really well-deserved win in the sunshine. Special mention to Dianne and Liz for helping us out and playing a stormer in the process!

This week, for the first league game of the season, the 1sts had 7 players unavailable. So a slightly make-shift but nevertheless strong team was assembled, with Watson stepping into the sweeper position for the first time, the day before setting off for university. Things were looking good pre-match though, with even Johnson showing that he was starting to appreciate the subtle nuances of the famous 'Pepper-Pot' warm-up (or 'Ring of Chaos' as someone bluntly put it).
Conditions were perfect - a warm sun, a gentle breeze, no thick clouds of hazardous chaff blowing across the pitch (see last week). The only possible down side was having to run around chasing a ball for 70 minutes. Fortunately South got off to a flying start, with two nearly identical short corners calmly deflected home by McCulloch from Johnson hits. South then settled down and started enjoying some position and flowing moves. Chalk once again was the unlucky one, being asked to fill in at right-back in a game that saw South attacking most of the time. But the back four were working well together, recycling and distributing the play like old-timers (one of them definitely looking more like an <b>old</b>-timer than the others...). This was despite the somewhat counter-productive and increasingly hysterical shouts from Aston, urging on his fellow defender with the helpful advice 'Don't panic!'.
With cunning that will stand him in good stead as a uni fresher hockey player, Watson carefully crafted an own goal from his well struck hit into the opposition's D, with the keeper helpless against his own defence. Not to be outdone (no-one likes to be shown how to score goals by defenders!), the South midfield and attack duly combined to score a fantastic team goal which started from the break-down of a Wisbech short-corner, and ended with Haslop showing excellent hand-eye coordination to slot home a lifted pass from McCulloch after some neat exchanges involving Halse, Johnson, Virdi - and probably plenty others. South went in at half-time 5-0 in front and cruising.
After waking Parker up for the half-time team talk (which involved the captain confessing to struggling with remembering his left and right...) South started strongly again, with another carbon-copy Johnson-McCulloch-back-of-the-net short-corner routine. With new recruit Broyd settling in to left mid and Virdi and Pearson also working hard in midfield, the attacking line was free to cause havoc. A loose ball in the D was pounced on by Virdi who showed exceptional mind-control skills to convince the entire Wisbech defence and their keeper to occupy the far side of the D while he calmly hammered the ball into the middle of the empty goal. The less said about his goal celebration the better.  Good interplay between Haslop, Snetler and Halse created a number of chances, with one notable one finding Halse in the D with the ball in front of an empty goal. I wouldn't be so cruel as to describe what happened next, but suffice it to say, we shall be gleefully reminding Halse of that moment for some time to come. Shortly after, McCulloch selfishly(?)  popped up again to flick home a rebound from a tight angle and bring the goal tally to 7. Despite numerous other attacks, South couldn't add to this but comfortably played out the final 10 minutes with some good possession.
This was all topped off with some quality match teas in the sun at the Red Bull (earning the bar-girl a (wo)man of the match vote, and a couple of players, who shall remain nameless, lemon votes for their dubious post-match dress-sense).","Men's 1sts thrash Wisbech Town 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",1

With a much-changed line-up and no substitutes compared to City&#39;s five subs, this looked like a challenging fixture. A 4-4-2 diamond formation was played for this one, with an unfamiliar central midfield pairing of Jon and Graham and a front pairing of Laurie and Dave H.
The game opened fairly evenly, with neither side really getting on top, but the first goal went to South mid-way through the 1st half. A scramble in the D lead to the ball rolling out to Rich C, arriving late in Paul Scholes-in-his-prime style, to slot past the defender on the line with the keeper nowhere.
A comic interlude was up next, with a tactical time-out / wind up the opposition moment generated by Chris G who was struggling to coordinate our marking of two City players both wearing number 5. As they helpfully pointed out, the shirts weren&#39;t the same colour (though you&#39;d think they probably should have been), but this was too much for Chris to cope with and so the umpire was forced to call a halt to the match whilst City shirts were switched. City equalised soon after from a short corner making it 1-1 at the break.
South started the 2nd half strongly and almost immediately took the lead for the second time. The quality and finesse of the goal is entirely explained by the sumptuous illustration crafted by the hand of Jack Chalk (see below). No further explanation needed obviously, but some might describe it as a tap-in for Dave following a good run from Jack and cross from Dom. City then levelled again from a short corner.
However, South were not to be denied and a speedy run up the left from Rich forced a short corner off a defender&#39;s foot. Hawkes&#39; shot caused all kind of mayhem (at least it might have) and the ball found its way to Graham for another tap-in. South saw out the match relatively comfortably and looked the stronger team in the second half, despite surely being exhausted towards the end due to the lack of subs (greater player availability expected next week...). Overall a good result without being at our best and a solid start to the season with two wins from two.

After yet another comprehensive bloodletting caused by lack of availability in the 1s, South fielded a rather makeshift team, with additions such as Neil Sneade, Tom South, Rupert Espley and James Paley putting in a very strong performance. Particularly of note was the striker Nick Wong, who hadn't played (hockey) for several years. With positioning, stick skills and speed turning him into a real menace for the defence, it wasnt long until Nick got himself onto the score board, pouncing on a loose ball in the D to sweep it into the inviting goal. Having secured his place back in the club, Nick then on to grab a lemon, complaining vociferously of a strained bum that took him out of the game. 
Undismayed, South kept on playing safe hockey, with a solid defence and quick breaks in attack. Mere minutes later, a smooth move up the right wing saw the ball arriving at Tim Clapp, who slotted it home from the acutest of angles to give South a two-goal cushion. 
Rutland were not giving up, however, and managed to claw back a goal before the break, when a fluffed short corner injection was deftly turned into a cunning flick over both the onrushing defence and keeper Shahbaz Ali.
In the second half, Rutlands younger legs (and subs) started to tell, with the home midfield struggling to stop mazy runs by some of the visiting youngsters. Just 5 minutes in, another short corner resulted in an equaliser, closely after followed by one of Rutlands central men running through the defence all too easily to have a free shot on goal, slotting it past Shahbaz who should never have been faced with the chance.
Despite hard graft by the home team (now reduced to the bare 11, as an old injury took out a highly solid Ed Broyd) and several short corners, an equaliser proved too much and South had to reluctantly concede defeat to pacy and skilful team. But the spirit and skills of the team, as well as its strength in depth, look promising for the remainder of the season.

A good crowd was there to watch, although many of them had turned up 90 minutes too early and were instead disappointed at having to watch City Mens 1 in the National League Conference. Once that warm-up event was out of the way (and Finn had found a stick) we were into the main event and South, playing in yellow after Ely turned up without their away strip were straight out of the blocks and onto the attack. 
The midfield of Hawkes, Johnson, Pearson and Chalk were dominant and provided plenty of action for the pace of McCulloch, Claes and Haslop. Driving forward positively, South forced a penalty corner after about 10 minutes and played the classic left slip then back to injector for McCulloch to do what he does best - get a fine touch and deflect it into the goal (Im sure that there are other things that McCulloch does well but surely nothing as well as this).
At this point it looked as if South were cruising to an easy victory and they continued to carve out chances but the Ely keeper was on good form, keeping out those shots that were on target, and South were rather profligate when in front of goal. Going into half time just 1-0 ahead, South were satisfied with the performance but frustrated that they had not manage to convert more of their chances. 
The second half continued in much the same vein with most of the play in the Ely half but no more goals forthcoming. As the game went on, Souths inability to finish meant that things became very nervous with Ely well aware that they could nick a point with just one good attack. They began to press forward more assertively and were often finding a spare man in midfield, although Souths midfield were not quite sure whos man it was. However, the defence of Graveling, Readman, Wych and Parsot were in fine form, snuffing out most of the attacks with some fine interceptions and tackles, with good interplay around the back. On the odd occasion that Ely did get a shot on goal Parker was more than a match for it, in particular making one superb stick save low down to his right.
The end result of 1-0 did not reflect Souths dominance of possession, but at least McCulloch will be able to sleep easy now  although we do have the small matter of the M1 v M2 match next Saturday.","Men's 1sts beat Ely City 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

This was a good idea until Neil and Ron got themselves lost on the final stretch, but as we set off just after sunrise we still made it there before pushback, which happened to be in the afternoon.
The team started the match off well, marking the forwards and playing some nice passes which created some chances and a couple of short corners. The opposition had a few strong players with some nice skills, but were largely kept in check for the first period. About 15 minutes in came the first goal from Lukas, hitting the ball very nicely on a reverse stick hit into the bottom left corner, following a good pass across from the right from Neil.
Alford kept battling but were denied any decent chances on goal due to some nice clean tackles, the pick of the tackles coming from Nick Venner in centre midfield, who cleanly poached the ball off of his opposite number. Unfortunately South went into the break level at 1-1 following a skilful dribble by their right wing, who shot from a tight angle, hitting the post that ricocheted out to another forward to slot home.
In the second half South won a quick short corner following a Bhav lob forward to Lukas who was fouled in the D. Unfortunately the short corner broke down and Alford countered, resulting in a goal within a minute of the restart.
Alford gained confidence with this goal and started putting the pressure on. Their forwards were mixing up their positions making it difficult for the South defence to organise a good enough resistance. Inevitably another goal came where their centre forward created enough room in front of Dom and Colin to smash home into the bottom left corner.
South had their heads down at this time, however up stepped Bhav to turn the tables and the flow of the game, with some nice composed play in the centre. The comeback commenced when Dom Nelson slotted home a goal following a spell of good pressure by South. A few short corners  provided some good chances where South were left frustrated. However, with a minute to go Bhav received the ball from the left side, he had 3 defenders in his way but managed to create some room to flick the ball in from near the penalty spot to tie the game.","Men's 2nds score a last minute equaliser against Alford & District 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

in the league so far. It all started according to plan both in defence and attack. Rich Morgan and Tom Anns were communicating well and were cancelling out their attackers with some tight marking, and Dom, Russ and Tim were producing some good runs and passing moves to create a few first half chances. Dom's solo effort, beating a few defenders deserved a goal but unfortunately he put his shot just wide of the post. Surprisingly the goal came from defender Tom Anns who slotted the ball home after a decent spell in the first 20 minutes of the game.
Soon after, however, the goal was cancelled out, when Nomads were awarded a free hit just outside the 25 line. An unlucky touch by Rich  deflected the ball past the utterly helpless Shahbaz - a textbook goal, just on the wrong side of the pitch. Nomads gained confidence from their equaliser and stepped up the pressure. The game was close thereon into the break, with neither team having a decent effort on goal.
The second half grew increasingly frustated to South, as that longed-for goal wouldn't materialise. Although South had more of the attack in this half, it was the home side that got the best chances, in the form of a few shorts. Luckily, their drag flick were no match on the  imperturbable Shabaz, so stale mate persisted to the final whistle. Virtually in the last minute, South were unluckyno to win their first (!) short of the game, when a Nomads defender seemed to put the ball directly over the backline; but it was not to be.
In fact, this pretty much sums up the game: although South can confidently say they were the stronger and more attacking side, Nomads held on with a combination of good defending and a touch of luck. With just a bit more luck, this game would've been deservedly won by South.
It cannot be denied that the team fought very hard during this game and stepped off the pitch with nothing more to give. The result may have been disappointing, the commitment wasn't - if we can harness these spirit in games to come, we will start gathering the points soon.","Men's 2nds draw against Cambridge Nomads 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

You're welcome.
So far this season, the 1sts have defeated all opposition. This week it was the turn of Peterborough. Peterborough 5ths to be exact. Yes - fifths. Ugh - we've go get out of this league! One thing was obvious from the start - they grow 'em big in Peterborough! I nearly told them they'd come to the wrong pitch for their rugby game. Banter! But what South lacked in physical stature, we made up for with hockey skills and sex appeal. Sexy hockey - that's how we do it at South baby.
After an inauspicious warm-up which lacked the love-it-or-hate-it Pepperpot/Ring of Chaos but did involve Captain Health and Safety cruelly banishing a couple of young boys who'd build a track for their toy cars in the practice area, we got underway. Immediately we put our camouflage pitch-green kit to good use, mounting a string of swift attacks which, had it not been for Graham's lack of talent - sorry, I mean new stick, which was apparently to blame for everything - would have seen us a couple of early goals in front. Peterborough seemed a bit sleepy in the late afternoon sun as Jon and Rich on the left and Lukas and Laurie on the right combined with Yours Truly in the middle to create some slick passing moves that we've been missing in the last couple of weeks. The crowd of supporters on the side-lines (both of them) sensed a break-through.
And sure enough, it came. South were awarded a short-corner. It went to Jon who gave his trademark lob-pass to the keeper - or as he insists on calling it, a 'drag-flick'. Graham, anticipating the save, pounced on the rebound and flicked it over the keeper. Its always embarrassing when you have to cut your goal celebration short so it was to his credit that, having seen a ninja defender spring from nowhere to deflect the ball off the line, off the cross-bar and probably the post for good measure, Graham had the presence of mind to finish the job properly, with a lifted reverse stick strike from a tight angle. 1-0. The crowd went wild. Well - one of them did. I think the other was sending a text at the time.
South kept pushing for another goal but Peterborough seemed to have woken up and South had to be all the more resourceful, with George making good use of every side of his stick and Chris making (not so) good use of every side of his body on the ground. The defence was forced to work (to be honest it did them good to run around a bit. Gotta keep the old legs ticking over at that age, stave off the arthritis etc.) but were more than up to the task, with 'Above-Average-Ed' in particular showing some flashes of skill as well as a cool head in the troublesome left-back position. 
Half-time came and went. The captain wittered on about tactics or something. I wasn't really listening - I was already thinking about what to write in this report. Then the unthinkable happened: Peterborough scored. They must have got lucky. Or been studying my skills during the first half. But suddenly there was a tension in the air. Our winning streak was on the line. A tense period of play followed, with both teams a bit too frenetic to produce any classy hockey that would break the deadlock.  When we did finally break the deadlock, it still wasn't classy, with another scrap in the D finally being slotted home by Jon, finally getting on the scoresheet for the season and moving above the likes of George and Average in the Goal King table.
For some crazy reason I was subbed off. As always when the team is without me, I feared the worst.  So I was surprised to witness what came next: a string of three quick goals all set up and dispatched brilliantly. Obviously the key was the teamwork - just think what a different story it would have been had I not been on hand on the sideline to direct people and 'pass orders down'. The first was a solo effort from Jon. Its amazing what one goal will do for a young lad's confidence. And even more amazing what it will do for an old codger like Hawkes. After the luck of the bounce favoured him following a tackle that Chris G would admiringly describe as 'robust', Jon found himself at the top of the D, staring into the whites of a now petrified keeper's eyes. Maybe the keeper had been to our training sessions and seen a few of Jon's hits. I'm pretty sure he didn't see this one though, as Jon unleashed a bullet of a shot past the keeper's head before he could even say 'Oh Sh...!'. The next two goals were practically mirror images of each other, both straight out of the F Johnson School of Sexy Hockey: Quick, incisive one-twos down the pitch between Chris P and Graham, with a final pass leaving the keeper with no chance of a save.  
There was still time for Chris G to stake a claim for Lemon (and almost Own-Goal-King-For-Life) with a horrendously executed Spin Of Doom which span off the back line, inches from his own goal. In the end though it was Jon who stole the Lemon Show. Presented with the ball mere inches (Finn-Inches, that is ;-) from the goal line, he somehow contrived to launch the ball over the cross-bar (and over the fence) in a cynical act of jug-avoidance.
And so the match finished. 5-1. But despite the score-line, Peterborough proved to be a surprisingly strong side with lots of skill and an excellent keeper. But enough about them - the South Winning Machine rolls on. Next stop for the Banter Bus: St Neots. Oh - and did I mention we're now two points clear at the top of the league?

As usual, everyone was enjoying the pre match banter until it was cut short by Captain McCulloch halfway through a warm up lunge; apparently having fun makes you play badly and vice versa! 
It turned out McCulloch was right, after a miserable warm up that nobody enjoyed, South started the match on fire, immediately dominating the play and sniffing around the St Neots D like a dog on heat.
The table topping South squad had welcomed new boys Machin and Broyd into the starting line up along with Williams, just back from a 7 week jolly. The players rewarded their teammates faith in different ways, Broyd and Machin with barn storming performances, Williams by getting a yellow card within 5 minutes.
Whilst Williams was off the pitch, uploading some more holiday snaps to Facebook, St Neots built some promising attacks and threatened to upset proceedings. Fortunately Souths back line held firm, with all 4 defenders making some important interceptions along the way.
After weathering the storm, South were able to settle into a good rhythm and started to play some attractive hockey. Despite a few changes to the team, South were gelling together well, making sensible supporting runs allowing easy passes to be made quickly. 
One such passing move down the right resulted in a cross being fired across the area, McCulloch was on hand to deflect the ball brilliantly into the top corner. Unfortunately it was disallowed. Some assumed the ball had gone out of play before being crossed but the umpire confirmed later that the goal was just too damn sexy for Division 3NW and any more like it would be penalised for un-sportsmanlike showing off!
Undeterred, South reverted to plan B and went in search of a goal more suited to their current standard. After winning a succession of short corners, Johnson managed to break the deadlock with a fairly dull goal from a top D straight hit routine. After confirming that it was suitably uninteresting, the umpires blew their whistle and South were in the lead, one they never looked like relinquishing.
To their credit, St Neots responded with intent after going behind but South were in a purple patch and refused to release their grip on possession. More short corners followed, some were fluffed, some led to more short corners and the worst of the lot went in! Johnson took it upon himself to change the routine agreed upon during the huddle and a well stopped ball that should have been slipped to one side was greedily topped towards goal. Unfortunately, the keeper failed to account for the slow pace or the unnatural spin on the ball as it wobbled through the air into the back of the goal. Everyone who saw if felt embarrassed, except Johnson who ran back to the halfway line proudly reading out his current heart rate from his completely unnecessary new watch.
At halftime McCulloch reiterated that we werent here to have fun and that despite being in the lead we had the ability to throw the game away at any point. Meanwhile Johnson had managed to get his heart rate down to that of a dozing Crocodile.
The second half started with Machin leading the frontline with distinction, McCulloch ferreting around for loose balls and waves of wingers and midfielders getting in on attractive South attacks.
There were numerous moves that could have ended with South adding to their tally, the finest of which resulted in McCulloch hilariously being denied a goal for the second time. After a free flowing movement that deserved to be recorded, set to classical music and played on this website in slow motion forevermore, South found themselves with a prostrate goalkeeper and an open net. McCulloch twatted the ball into the top corner from an impossible angle, but again he was denied by the umpires. There was a rumour that Williams had been seen whacking the keeper with his stick before feeding McCulloch but once again, the umpire confirmed that goals that foxy are only permitted in Div 2 and above. Never mind Graham, Barton is well ahead in Goal Kings already so it wouldnt have made much difference in the grand scheme of things!
South returned to trying to score crappy goals and presented Hawkes with a perfect opportunity to scuff the ball into an open goal from an inch out after a defensive cock up. However, Hawkes obviously thinks hes a bit special and refused to score such an easy goal. Rather, he waited for a defender to stroll back and tackle him on the line - well done, Jon - you really are special!
Moments later, Williams showed that he is happy to score goals of any quality and put the game to bed with an unmarked 2 yarder for which he would like to thank the St Neots defence for completely switching off at a free hit.
As the game (much like this report) dragged on, chances came and went; Broyd surged forward from right back and was involved in much of Souths good work whereas at left back, Dave Ashton was randomly screaming for no reason. Pearson and Claes used up the last ounces of juice running their markers ragged giving Wych and Gravelling plenty of time to chat about the joys of fatherhood and other exciting topics on the halfway line.
Eventually the umpires decided they had seen enough and blew for full time. Another 3 points for South and a reasonably good performance - well done chaps.
As a brilliant aside, AA Aston had to shoot off early for some imaginary social event and his car broke down on the way home, delaying him by over an hour, which just goes to show, theres always time for a shower!","Men's 1sts beat St Neots 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Even our 1sts played their part by having a full squad available for their game, so not needing any players.
Excellent we thought, only to discover that our captain had decided it was time for him to head off somewhere for some thing or other that we really can't remember. It might have been important, but who knows. A further blow was struck when the vice captain decided he had solved all crime in the country for the year and was putting in a transfer to special branch. To track down oil barons and money launderers we were told, and is currently somewhere between the Middle and Far East. Further information can't be disclosed at this time. Two defenders down, not a problem we should be fine. Then some idiot thought it would be a good idea to play 5-a-side the night before a crucial game, and promtply did something to his knee, or ankle or achilles or whatever. An early morning text on Saturday saying that he was unable to walk appeared and we were down another player, not wanting to name names but Dom really what were you thinking.
So it came to the game on Saturday at the sandpit, we skipped the pre-match talk and warmup we have all become accustomed to, and started playing. The team play, passing and leadership was incredible during the first half and was something to be witnessed, or so I have been reliably informed, we went into the break leading 2-1. Providing any more details would be unfair as up to this point I hadn't turned up! A well placed source has told me what happened though. We took the lead when a penalty corner was rocketing towards the bottom corner and hit a defender, the flick was scored with confidence by Tom Howells. The second goal came 20 minutes in after a good passing move (honest this is what happened) was finished off with Dave lifting the ball over the keeper. So 2-0 and coasting, first win of the season coming surely........ How wrong we can be, after missing numerous chances to wrap the game up, half of which were from penalty corners we then conceded a sloppy goal. The defence and midfield parting like the Red Sea allowing a forward to run from Wisbech to Cambridge unchallenged into our D. 1 complete miss-hit cross later and we are on the back foot at 2-1. The blame for this goal post match lay firmly on the captain for not stopping play with a scything stick tackle.
Half time came and went, things were said, I think were different to what we are used to, a bit of a reshuffle followed, and we came out confident of extending our lead. What happened however was simply shambolic. Going forward we looked positive and dangerous continuing to win penalty corners and making their keeper pull off a number of good saves. On the break however we got ripped to pieces. Wisbech quickly equalised from a penalty corner that Tom Anns pushed round the post with his foot. Shabaz couldn't get near the flick. A 3rd followed shortly after from a rifled shot from the top of the D, and a 4th sealed the game with 5 minutes to play from a reverse stick strike where again a forward was given too much time and space in the area.
Lessons were learnt, they were similar to other games, we can play better, we need to play our hockey and we need to perhaps consider converting some of the 17 penalty corners we had. It also helps for a midfield to provide some cover for what was a weakened defensive unit. Teas were again good, with new rituals introduced.

Preparations had gone well: team was out early, the new James Bond release was well timed so that Friday night thoughts turned towards cinema instead of lash, and to top things off, Manchester University held its reading week, enabling Tom Watson to come home to play for us, and more importantly, get his washing done (and perfect his strawpedo-ing apparently)
Warm up went without too many mishaps, except for Average forgetting his stick, which apparently is a big deal.   Whatever mate, hockeys all in the mind.   Anyways, with the BK leading the warm up (which *coincidentally* meant Ring of Chaos was absent) and making sure we were well stretched, we were definitely ready to roll.   Sideline talent count was 2 by the way, for those that were wondering.
So, we were ready to smash em from the off and start with a bang.   We didnt.   Within a minute or two, the Centre forward had ghosted (Halloween banter) through the defence, only to be thwarted by Parker in the goal.   Unfortunately the forward pounced on the rebound to loop a Hawkes short corner style shot into the net, despite the best (but ultimately, mediocre) attempts of Average to keep it out on the line.
After this goal though, we did spring into life.   Passing round the midfield was brilliant, and we were beginning to find gaps in the Wis defence, particularly on our right hand side.   Chances came and went: Twatson sent a reverse stick shot just past the post, Laurie sent a drive inches wide, and Gareth thundered an undercut against the upright when it looked as if the net would bulge.   Up the other end, our defence had woken up and despite a short corner shot whistling past the upright at half time, there was no real danger.
Half time team talk: G-unit stressed the team was playing well and that heads shouldnt drop, even if Wisbech got another goal early in the second half.
So, after the break, South came out all guns blazing, and Wisbech scored again.   This time you couldnt blame anyone- the forward unleashed a rocket into the bottom corner on the reverse side, not too shabby at all.   But South did react this time.   After another Twatson (who was having a fantastic game) strike cannoned off the post, a through ball found G dawg who struck a powerful shot into the far corner.   
Five minutes later, South were level.   Another great through ball found Graham, who produced a goal straight from the Finn Johnson school of finishing: slow, dribbled, bobbled over the keepers foot, but ultimately very effective.   Two-two, and Wisbech knew the last quarter would be a real struggle.
And it was.   We pushed forward in desperate search of a winner which would send us clear at the top of the table, small chances came and went, whilst they were looking dangerous-ish on the counter.
Then the unthinkable happened.   With three minutes left, Wiz cannoned the ball towards the goal from just inside the 25.   The ball passed through one, two, three south sticks, before finding the unmarked forward to deflect home past Steves despairing dive from all of 3 yards.
We pushed forward in search of a second equaliser (or Ekwalizaa, if youre Finn), but it didnt arrive before the final whistle (in fact it didnt arrive after it either).   We certainly didnt deserve to lose, but credit to them, they took more of their chances than we did.  
General positives to come out of Saturday were:
-	We went toe-to-toe with the team now top of the division
-	For the first time ever against Wisbech 2s, there wasnt a fight
-	Related to this, no-one touched Steves kit
-	Tom Watson is having a great time at uni, even if he cant strawpedo.
-	The guys at bowling know Finns name
-	I dont drive a Rover anymore
-	According to John, Skyfall is pretty good so make sure you go and see it.

Those that know our illustrious leader would know that he would disapprove of such a democratic process so it was a good job that we had Virdi hailing from the worlds largest democracy in charge for the game.
An ambitious 4-3-3 system was eventually settled upon to make more use of the large magnitude of forwards we seem to be bringing to games, with a big emphasise on keeping shape and picking up your players. 
A quick warm up, the whistle was blown and what a start by South. Free flowing passing, players sticking to their men and a level of competence and organisation not seen since the promotion campaign of 2 years ago. South went ahead after 10 minutes through a short. The code sign McCulloch was given and the ball smoothly returned to Nelson the injector. However City were wise to the most famous short corner routine in 3NW so Dom clearly rolled it back to Venner who pushed it over line and celebrated in triumphant style.
Buoyed by his goal Venner soon won another short however in doing so his calves of glass shattered and he was forced to limp off the side line. Perhaps out of concern for their team mate this short came to nothing. This did not trouble South and shortly after a second goal was added by Wong after a period of prolonged pressure, Snetler picked up the ball, beat a player, then slipped it through to leave Wong to coolly finish.
2-0 is a dangerous position for the 2's to be in as we discovered last week and true to form things started to go wrong. City had their best spell of pressure as South's midfield struggled to organise itself and waves of City attacks hurled them at the South back line forcing Shahbaz into several saves. With 5 minutes to go it was a game against the clock would the half end or City score? Unfortunately for them they decided to attack down the left where they would come across Virdi in full defensive mode. Captain, Leader, Hero is the only way to describe him in those closing minutes as City tried repetitively to beat him 3 on 1 only for Bhav to win the ball each time and clear safely to the sideline.
At half time again the importance of keeping shape was reiterated by the stand in captain, before in perhaps the most shocking moment of the day Rick returning from a six year walkabout in the African jungle launched into a tear jerking speech. Its a shame I cannot remember any of it...
South started the 2nd half as they did the 1st bossing the game and it was not long before a South high press forced city into playing the ball straight to Howell. To be fair to the keeper he covered his near post well, but this only allowed Tom to place (yes place not smack as hard as he could) the ball into the middle of the goal (great restraint by the way mate you have clearly learnt from the cross bar incident at the Peterborough summer tournament). Soon it was 4 as city left Wong all alone in their half. Anns pushed the ball well ahead of him and Wong was off with no one having any chance of catching him. The one worry of the situation by his own admission he did not know what to do when 1 on 1 with the keeper. Lucky he picked the correct option - slip it past him and score.
City then won a lucky short - but the defensive line were not worried having noticed their star drag flicker off the pitch. The shot, although I am sure Shahbaz our resident expert would claim was not technically a drag flick, was very hard and megged Bhav on the line. 4-1.
This just spurred South on and the midfield off, Erlebach, Chalk, Howell and later Halse simply kept the ball between them and the back four, for much of the rest of the half. On one of the few occasions the ball was given away, Nelson pressing high against their 16 (at the familiar centre back position at the top of the opponents D) cut out a cross field ball, squared it to Johnson to run onto and push past the furiously exposed keeper. 5-1.
City pushed extra hard for the last 7 minutes and the heavens seemed to agree with unleashing a torrent a hail down on the brave men in green. This predictably led to a number of comedy falls. Of particular note was Anns and Nelsons synchronised effort to allow a City forward through on goal. He then also decided he needed a little rest and also flung himself to the ground for which South were awarded a free hit (simulation?). One City player thought this was a great decision and applauded the umpire for making the difficult choice. He also thought moving the ball up 10 was not harsh enough a punishment for the heinous diver and called to the umpire well done, keep going. To which the umpire replied OK up another 10. I believe the said player was then quickly subbed off for some reason.
With one minute to go all looked well Anns took a 16 to Oli and South looked like holding on to their 4 goal lead. However Oli was clearly jealous of Tom and Dom's rests on the ground and decided to take this moment to have a little lie down himself.  His man said thank you very much and unleashed a thunderbolt of a reverse stick shot Lucas would be proud of to take a little of the shine off the finish. 5-2. All that remained was for Snetler to push back to Chalk and for him to hold the ball for the last couple seconds until the final whistle and the 2's 1st win.
In his role of captain of democratic justice Bhav might have taken this slightly too far with each player having to vote in approximately 47 categories at the end of the game instead of just man and lemon of the match. Here are some of the highlights:

As this is Cambridge South (not City) we obviously took the latter option. Those poor Rutland kids - it wasn't their fault Wisbech had angered the South Beast. They honestly didn't know how to cope with the incisive passing that tore through their defence time and again.
Arriving in freezing drizzle, it took a lot of effort to drag ourselves out of the changing rooms and onto the pitch. Ultimately it was George who took charge of clearing the changing room with some ill-advised and worryingly enthusiastic chat about 'long ribbed shafts'. Once on the pitch, the Ring of Chaos settled everyone down. Even the announcement from the opposition coach that they always played with smooth balls drew no comment from George. 
South started brightly and made sure most of the hockey was played in the Rutland half. Within 5 minutes, a Rutland 16 was turned over and fed back to Graham to put him through one-on-one with the keeper. Now, its not like the captain to blow his own trumpet (much) but if they wrote textbooks on scoring goals (and Finn is probably considering this as you read...) you'd probably read about this goal in one of those books. A change of direction to the right as the keeper rushed out, and then a crisp shot to the far corner from the edge of the D beating the keeper's despairing dive. 
It was soon apparent that more goals would come and everyone was eager to get on the score-sheet. None more so than Tom, who wasted no time in rifling home a superb volley to deflect a short corner into the net. Those who point out that this was our own net and a Rutland short corner are, as Jon would say, just too negative. 
Right then. As a full recap of each goal would a) bore you to death and b) threaten the mighty Brynjolffssen's reputation as Match Report King, I'll summarise in bullet point here:
	2-1 Rich (sublime reverse stick deflection into the top corner)
	3-1 Jon (capping some great flowing play with a pile-driver from the top of the D)
	4-1 Rich (something else awesome)
	5-1 Mark (calmly (is he ever anything else?) slotting home a cross that beat everyone else)
	6-1 Finn (standard)
	7-1 Jon (a Barton-esque reverse stick on the turn)
	8-1 Graham (trademark 'McCulloch' short-corner routine. They've done studies you know. 60% of the time, it works every time)
South admittedly took their foot off the gas a bit in the 2nd half. In fact Dave took his feet off the pitch entirely for large periods of time, preferring to play on his knees. A worrying trend it would seem...
Not many of us noticed really as we were far too busy counting the number of times Finn's opposite man (sorry - child) beat him with the same trick, each one greeted by a more and more exasperated 'lecture to self' from the BK. The highlight for all was when he finally picked one and cheered himself - only to discover it was a different kid entirely.
With such a sound thrashing of the 4th placed team in the league - at their place no less, the 1sts now have to make sure we play to our potential and win every game between now and Christmas. ","Men's 1sts thrash Rutland 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

I do not want to talk about this.
Nevertheless, South started poorly and could not get their team to gel, not helped by constant substitutions. Ely broke the South defence twice. I had a great view of the 1st from the bench  as the Ely midfielder ran into the D, was pushed wide and mis-hit his reverse stick shot into the ground resulting in a high bounce past Shabaz in goal. Howells also managed to get a green card for a tackle that I believe is called the Oren. The 2nd was a result of sloppy marking resulting in a free player and a simple finish. South came into half time braced from the sure bollocking from the returned skipper. He was surprisingly calm and did not shout, this means he was particularly furious...
<strong>The 2nd half:</strong>
A re-jig to the substitution plan and suddenly South came out of the blocks flying. Slick passing, a great press and a new look highly organised South had Ely on the back foot. In fact they barely touched the ball for the 1st 25 minutes of the half. After 10 minutes Erlebach picked up a loose ball in midfield and played it to Chalk in the centre. A quick 1-2 with Venner left Chalk driving down the base line. As the keeper came to greet him a simple pull back to Paley allowed him to score a simple tap in to the open net. More of this please. Midway through the half South were level. Another drive down the base line by Chalk led to the pass back being cut out with the back of an Ely stick. Dom produced a fine injection and Howells slipped the ball left to Snetler as planned. Lucas was then meant to shoot at the goal, but being Lucas he had to let the ball role across his body onto  his reverse stick allowing the Ely defence to close him down. Just as his team mates had given up and were falling back into defensive positions, he pulls out a fantastic reverse stick pass back to the injector, gifting Dom an easy deflection to level the score.
It's a shame this could not last and shortly afterwards more substitutions caused confusion in the midfield (ie let's play 2 players on the left and none on the right, Ely will not expect that). There was also a fair few dodgy challenges around the D. From one of these an Ely played drove around the D and fired a reverse stick cross into the goal. Despite 3 South players on hand to help the umpire with his decision it was ruled inside the D and the goal given. This player also got the 1st goal and got the Ely LoM for never having scored with his reverse stick before today. South then went back to playing the way they did in the 1st half so I will gloss over that again. Ely scored a 4th with 5 minutes to play as a through ball was mis-controlled by a forward and the South player in goal (naming no names) stepped on his own pads preventing himself from moving as it trickled past him and over the line. Another card for South for poor attitude and a yellow for Ely for breaking down play were not enough for South to get back into the game despite dropping a defender to play with yet another forward. A game to forget, next week let's play like they are City again please lads.","Men's 2nds lose to Ely City 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Saturday 10th November, 2012 will go down in the Cambridge South Hockey Club record books*. Yes, it was indeed a record-breaking day. For that day, that unprecedented, bookie-defying, crowd-pleasing day, was the day that Average received his lowest ever number of Lemon of the Match votes (1). Oh - and we scored 12 goals and conceded none. So there's that too. 'Every cloud...' and all that.
Fear not - I won't detail all 12 (not even in bullet points). Partly because I can't remember them (although when has that ever stopped a South report-writer from crafting an eloquent and astonishingly precise description of a goal) but mostly because they weren't all that exciting.
After last week's 8-1 Rout of Rutland speculation was rife about what would unfold this week. Which may explain the bet that Miss Baker is now bitterly regretting: For every goal her beloved Jon scored, Graham would buy them both a drink. But for every goal Graham scored, both Bex and Jon would buy Graham a drink. It would prove to be a very expensive day for Miss Baker...
With the twin pairing (not my expression) of Bhav and Paresh filling in at the back for the absent Graveling and Wych, and spurred on by the absence of Finn for the week, South started the match brightly. It wasn't long before crowds of female supporters were flocking to the side-lines to cheer on the home team. This didn't have quite the desired effect, with several slap-stick comedy falls in the near vicinity of the ladies, presumably brought on by an over-eagerness to impress.
Despite large amounts of possession and acres of space in midfield for Mark, Jon and Jack, South struggled in the first half to find the net, with just a tap-in from Rich, a 'got it on the 4th attempt' push from Graham and another flick from Graham slotted past the keeper after a perfect set-up from Laurie. So 3-0 at half-time. The half-time talk centred around keeping our structure, discipline and intensity and not settling for a simple 4-0 victory or anything like that. 
Message received. Have South ever scored 9 goals in one half of hockey? The second half really is a testament to the whole team's commitment to those three things: structure, discipline and intensity. Many of the goals were tap-ins. But we were able to score these tap-ins because we'd passed the ball quickly and accurately and everyone had maintained their positions. Jack, Jon and Mark all enjoyed lots of possession and space in midfield but much credit must go to the wingers, Rich, Chris and Laurie, who's tireless work created most of the chances and who also netted 5 goals between them.
With the South press intercepting almost all Alford passes towards the forwards, they were forced to throw aerials in a desperate attempt to make any attacking progress. In hindsight this tactic proved about as successful as most of the BK's chat-up lines, with the aerial bombardment dealt with professionally and skillfully by Twin #1 (Bhav).
Not to be outdone, Twin #2 (Paresh) and the ever-impressive Ed Broyd both played crucial roles in seeing off any further Alford attacks - largely by scaring the younger opposition players with their rather creepy moustaches. I think Average was playing as well - although to be honest I don't really remember any contributions from him.
And so the final whistle blew. The umpires got their calculators out, had a brief conflab and agreed on the score. 12 unanswered goals for South. A record of some sort, I'm sure. And six for the skipper. 
Much credit to Alford & District who are a great bunch of guys and all came back for teas despite the heavy loss, traffic jams and the prospect of a long drive home.
And much credit to the side-line talent, I mean support, for the cheering. We can't promise that many goals every week but we'll try!

From the whistle Newmarket dominated possession, but South did an amazing job in defence, organised by Dom, denying several attempts. Unfortunately it wasn't enough with Newmarket going one up. Unfazed South stepped it up a gear with lots of movement, runs and passes taking the fight back to Newmarket and creating some chances of their own. Pressure from Newmarket remained throughout the half, but South held their ground, Shabaz in goal making several saves and good marking from South forcing Newmarket to try the million-dollar pass more often that they'd like.
After half-time, it was South that came out the strongest, putting pressure of their own on the Newmarket defence. Mere minutes into the half, they had their reward: a short corner neatly slipped right found its way to the skipper for a half-foot tap in (that's distance, not fouling, you cynics). South was back in the game and could even be said to be on the front foot.
Soon after, the visitors had the best chance yet to pull ahead. Untiring runs from Nick, Russ and Tim made a slip by the defence inevitable. Tim pounced on a bad received ball and found himself alone with the Newmarket goalie. A sliding tackle just clipped enough of Tim's feet to put his shot wide and the umpire didn't hesitate to give a flick. Naturally, Newmarket felt this was unfair (though we note that the goalie never did complain...), but who would ever doubt an umpire's decision? Selflessly, Dom stepped up to try his luck, mano-a-mano with the keeper. Even more selflessly, he decided to keep the game interesting: a low ball to the keeper's right met with stick for a save.
Now the boot was well and truly on the other foot. Newmarket was revitalised and South lost some of their spirit. The rest of the half is a bit of a blur: Newmarket scored a few times. They had more shorts that Nick's made inappropriate comments to girls. We tried hard to get one back, but failed. Dave ran circles around every single person in the Newmarket defence. Tim thought he was the Pope and kissed the turf, in the hope that would give us some divine inspiration. 
Final result 5-1. Overall South did well against league leading Newmarket, never surrendering and creating opportunities until the bitter end. This is the kind of hockey we should play against every team in the league! ","Men's 2nds lose to Newmarket 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

The fact they did not beat us until the last 20 minutes of the game might have something to do with the fact they chose not to include it, anyway I digress. 
As a side we were hoping for a bigger improvement on the pitch than that which we need to make on the current attendance at training. 
Bhav started his quest for lemon early on in the week. In fact the previous weeks' game had only just ended when he made his first move by leaving his stick behind. He followed this up with a week long email campaign, demanding banter, overloading spam filters, and sending everything twice. Although this did provide excellent distraction from the fact the team was only announced on Friday afternoon. One of many outlandish rumours was this was delayed we believe this was due to the fact Ron was pre-occupied getting his perm done.
And so we got to match day, it was an early start for the 2s, with many waking up to a dark cold November morning, earlier than they would usually get up for work. For once we all made it to the right pitch in Peteborough on time but our expert warm-up plan was ruined with early excuses ranging from tiredness, jet lag, feeling ill (""It's not a hangover!"") and other niggling minor injuries. It turned out that none were needed.
South started well, passing accurately and with good pace, it was soon clear that this was a very winnable game. Souths retention of the ball was a great improvement on previous games, with steady passages of possession, and great distribution by the back four. This produced some early opportunities for South, testing their keeper several times in the first 15 minutes. 
Things at this point were getting boring, with the opposition barely threatening our goal, and Shabaz was getting sleepy, a quick 16 would change all this with an attempted cross field ball being picked off by their striker unmarked, unchallenged and with the entire D to himself. He didn't even hit the target and calm was restored.
That seemed to wake us up and after 20 mins we would get our first. It came from a South short corner, the direct hit in by Lucas was saved, with Orens mishit follow up trickling over the line, even the opposition match report described it as such, so it was a true classic. The rest of the half was otherwise an uneventful but with lots of energy shown by South, good passing, dribbling and tackling. More opportunities were bound to come if we could keep this up. 
Half time came and went, Rick we believe was channelled through Colin and came up with the inspiring words, ""their keeper is good, lets pass it round him"" Not long into the second half we would get our 2nd goal it came from a lighting fast counter attack. Their short corner broke down, Bhav took the hit early playing it straight to Lucas, then on to Rus, who made a great run up the right to cross it to Venner for a sweep finish into the middle of the goal. All with such pace that all but 3 Peterborough defenders were still in our half when the ball hit their backboard. Colin or as we shall now call him Rick Jr's words were inspired. 
After a the defence had dealt with a bit of extended pressure, we did need something to do after all, the 3rd goal came. Again from a Bhav aerial from a 16 to Rus, who took the ball again up the line, outpacing and dribbling through 3 Peterborough defenders (who were all closer to our goal than theirs), drawing the keeper, then selflessly slipping the ball to Venner for a repeat of the second goal. 
At 3 - 0 the champagne hockey began, Tom ""Im not hungover I'm just ill"" Anns went for an audacious, intrepid, penetrating charge through the centre of the Peterborough team, taking the ball from the top of our D right up the field into the opposition D for a one on one with their keeper. Ann's unfortunately went to the Torres school of finishing, however this did not take anything away from his showboating display of hockey finesse. (Rumours are rife that interest has been shown by Chelsea to the tune of 55m. We are still waiting for their call).
South continued to play confident, flowing hockey, keeping possession well but were coming under increasing pressure, most of which came from shorts that could have been prevented. The 5 yard rule apparently needs explaining at this point. If you are within 5 yards of a player when he takes a free hit inside the 25 do not tackle him! At one point even the umpire was laughing after a shout of ""you're not 5 yards, let him run, let him run don't tackle him"" deafness had apparently set in. From the resulting short corner Shabaz was beaten for the first time, only to have Colin glance it round the post. 
Could we handle the pressure and keep a clean sheet, unfortunately not a rare poor clearance from South invited a Peterborough player to have a shot from the top of the D, which somehow found a gap through the otherwise (insert appropriate positive adjective reflecting commanding, confident play backed up with a high level of proficiency in his role) Shabaz (up until this point he may or not have made a save). South heads remained high, with only 15 minutes left on the clock, we refused to snatch another defeat from the jaws of victory.
For those of you who noticed the LoM nomination earlier may have noticed that Bhav has not been mentioned much since. Well having picked up a green card earlier in the match for what was almost a full on rugby tackle the real Bhav would show his true colours in the last few minutes. Not content that we may not be under enough pressure with a newly-uplifted Peterborough team decided that he should take the opportunity to display his footballing prowess. Earning perhaps some applause from the rumoured Chelsea scout on the side line, the umpire was nowhere near as impressed and showed his appreciation with a yellow card. Ironically for Bhav, had he just let the player beat him, his touch was so bad we would have got the ball back. After a small reshuffle South saw out the remainder of the game under not great pressure, bringing back all 3 points to Cambridge.
Honourable mention needs to go to the team tea that was an upbeat affair, with everyone relieved to have an all-important win in the bag. Colin took the opportunity to practise his reading, by trying to read out loud the man of the match and lemon votes - this did not go well Perhaps this was highlighted by the absence of 'Motivational Public Speaker UK 2012 (TM)' Rick Erlebach who had fallen asleep at this point (This may or may not be true), or the fact that half of the team it seems can't write in English, where is the rumoured CSHC App everyone is talking about?
After such an important win against a struggling team, we need a similar performance against St Neots next week. The only problem, South 2's only win when South 1's lose, and they are playing Nomads this week but then since so many people don't know we have match reports, or where to find them maybe they won't notice this fact! Experience is crucial in situations like this, and with a combined 791 caps between us this might have been one of the most experienced South teams ever.","Men's 2nds claim an excellent win at City of Peterborough 5","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0
1396,"24/11/2012","League",1,35,"12:30",9,"Away","7","4","2","2","False","False","False","After taking a break from hockey in the second half of last weeks game South arrived fully refreshed this week to take on struggling local rivals Nomads M2s. It being well into Movember there was more facial hair on show than at a Mexican girls' school. Top prize for pogonotrophic effort went to Paresh, sporting the kind of luxuriant bush that Aston can only dream of. Laurie on the other hand was driven to the extreme of forgetting his shorts in the hope of distracting attention from his pre-pubescent soup strainer. The tactic did not work - see Lemon result above.
Nomads are bottom of league without a win to their name so South, still harbouring promotion aspirations, were looking for a comprehensive victory. That the game did not turn out like that is a credit to the opposition who showed a level of skill and pace in midfield and attack well above their League position. It all started out well; South were dominant in the first quarter, the midfield linking well with the forward line and the defence having little to do. Nomads were regularly gifting the ball back to South from 16s and a goal was inevitable. It came after about 10 minutes when Gareth received the ball just inside the D on the left post, he turned and fired a rocket of a shot at waist height into the goal. It was a good goal but nothing compared to the celebration which was magnificent.
South continued to press for a second goal and perhaps were guilty of a little complacency as more players were committed upfield and Nomads began to exploit the space behind midfield. Midway through the first half they won a few short corners, one of which was just about charged down by the South runners but the ball fell kindly for the Nomads forward to fire it just inside Parkers right hand post and level the scores at 1-1.
The match was more open now; Nomads skilful midfielders were seeing more of the ball and creating some concern for the South defence. However, it was South who scored next when Laurie received the ball just outside the D and squeezed it through a melee of defenders to find Graham lurking on the P-spot to deflect the ball past the despairing keeper. 
Surely South would now put the hammer down and finish off the game? Not a bit of it, Nomads came back strongly not just to equalise before half time when a midfielder dribbled through several defenders and passed to the centre forward who scored from an incredibly tight angle but then to take the lead shortly after the restart with a goal that I remember nothing about. Must have been a good one.
There was disbelief in the faces of the South players. 3-2 down against the bottom of the League with 25 minutes to play was not where we had expected to be. However, this squad is now confident in its ability to score in the last quarter (c/f Peterborough game) and if there was concern at being a goal down, there was certainly no panic. The defence tightened up the marking and this allowed the midfield more freedom to push forward. And the goals came in quick succession; first another from the  officially prolific McCulloch, playing a magical deflection behind his back from Pareshs cross and then 2 Claes Classics, using his pace to burn off the opposition and using the opponents body parts to deflect the ball into the goal.
So 3-2 down was converted to 4-3 up and there was still the best to come. From a Nomads attack cleared away by Graveling, South stormed up the field with a series of passes; Paresh to Finn to Graham to Gareth and then a neat square pass to Laurie who lifted the ball over the keeper. It was probably the best goal ever scored on a hockey pitch. And just to round off the day in style, captain McCulloch completed a hat-trick by thumping Souths 7th goal in from a tight angle in the dying minutes.
Somewhere in amongst that goal-fest Nomads got a consolation 4th goal when a firm shot was deflected off a South stick past Parker. They certainly deserved it, and probably more than just one; although the scoreline reads 7-4 to South, in fact the result was really in the balance for most of the match and South players left the pitch feeling slightly relieved that the 3 points were in the bag.","Men's 1sts beat Cambridge Nomads 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

But it was certainly wet, grey and miserable when the mighty 2s convened to vanquish yet another foe (not that last weeks win has gone to our head or anything!).

Unlike earlier weeks, however, the Pepperpot actually worked!
Properly fired up now, surely wed quickly pound St Neots into a thin light-blue layer on the pitch? Tell you what - well give em push-back. Let them throw an aerial into our D - whats the worst they can do? Ah - score. Were yet to dare ask whether this has set a new record for the least auspicious start of a game ever...
The rest of the half is a bit of a blur. We denied St Neots any further goals. Dom spent time lying on the ground. We slowly crept forward. Dom spent time lying on the floor. We couldnt get a proper attack going. And Dom spent some time on his arse.
Having weathered a storm of our own making, we finally started getting into our game in the second half. Passes got strung together. Dom spent more time lying on the floor. Shorts were won and wasted. Dom extended his lying on the floor to St Neots D. Chances were created. Dom finally made good use of his well-honed gravitational appeasement skills and scored, while lying on the ground. With about 10 minutes to go, we were back in the game! Moments later, we were also playing against 10 men, due to a somewhat overly graphical disagreement with the umpires decision. As the clock ticked down, both possession and territory were ours to lose - but with no more goals forthcoming, both sides heaved a secret sigh of relief to have escaped with a draw.
In the aftermath of the game (or pub as we call it) there were more surprises to be had. In a barnstorming performance at the hustings, Dom managed to clear the field completely and claim both Man and Lemon of the Match for the same reason. But then, you have to applaud his skill at playing hockey while face-down on the turf for the whole 70 minutes...
Lessons must be learned from this game - mostly to start playing from the first whistle, not a minute later. But there were plenty of good moments, leading to protracted pressure on St Neots defence.

With most of the Mos gone and Ron in America; Colin stepped up; but wait why does he still have the Mo and the beard? The team arrived an hour early to get acclimatised to the arctic weather! Ah the beard makes sense now! We were strong in our heads and decided not to show any respect to Wisbech.
Wisbech started as the crowd expected and they kept moving the ball around better than South. We were chasing shadows for the first 5 minutes and took us time to adjust to the organised outfit of Wisbech. 
The first goal was scored when a long aerial ball by Bhav that travelled 5 meters went straight to the Wisbech stick. They moved fast into the D and got a PC. Wisbech were ruthless. A pass to the left post and a deflection in the goal. 0-1! 
Although Wisbech took the lead; the three Musketeers Lucas, Tom H and Nick; were running around the Wisbech defence. A lot of the attacks were stopped by Dave, Jack, Ed & James in the mid field.
Wisbechs 2nd goal wasnt bad either. They ran with the ball in the centre, passed it to the attacker in the D. A little space given in D and the striker hit the ball over diving Shahbaz. 
We did get couple of PCs but Wisbech defence was strong. Rest of the half was played where the defence of Tom A, Oli, Colin & Bhav tried to not let the score line become bad looking. The half time whistle went and the score was a respectable 0-2. 
Colin gathered troops and his great lecture was recorded on each iPhone on the pitch and the players have decided to play it to their grandchildren. With a few changes to the midfield and renewed courage the seconds were attacking Wisbech from the whistle. 
After 10 minutes, in one of the moves Lucas got the ball on the top of the D, a good dribble into the D and PC! A cunning southern hemisphere lad he is! A perfect insertion from Ed, perfect stop by Jack, a perfect hit by Tom H and a perfect McCulloch by Ed led to one of the goals which brought tears to the writers eyes! 1-2 and 10minutes gone in the 2nd half!!
Dave with his lightning fast runs, James with his ball on the foot of the Wisbech defender and then I go into the D moves, Nick with his 3D skills and Lucas with his reverse hits; were bisecting the Wis defence like knife through butter!
In one of the fantastic moves Tom H passed the ball into the D and a free Ed did what he has been doing all season. Scoring every time he is in front of the goal. 2nd goal for Ed and it was game on!!
Wisbech were woken up from their cold afternoon siesta. 15 minutes to go. Could M2 hold them to 2-2? Such was the tension that the crowd were chewing the nails on their fingers and toes, never mind the fingers and ties were already frost bitten!
Wisbech attacks were being held with Ed, Jack and Tom in the mid field and where they missed the ball the back four were defending well, and when the back four failed they ran into the great wall of Cambourne - Shahbaz. 
But fortune favours the brave and in one such fortunate for Wisbech moment a strong cracked ball from the right hit the South players foot in the D and when everyone were waiting for the umpire to give a PC; the ball went straight to the Wisbech attacker who was free to slot in the goal. Very unfortunate for South! Good advantage given there umpire! 2-3! 10 minutes to go
In another Wisbech attack it was Shahbaz Vs the Wisbech attacker and the wall stood tall again. 
Wisbech attacks were coming thick and fast now. Another attacker was then given the slightest of chance in the D and he cracked in their 4th goal. 
The last 5 minutes were spent fighting out the Wisbech attacks and we counter attacked on the first given chance. 
The final whistle went and South did themselves proud by putting up a good fight against the table toppers. South travel to Rutland next Saturday.","Men's 2nds lose to Wisbech Town 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Johnny Hawkes and I are always ready for a mix off so we pushed Sneade to one side and bribed Serin to clear the tables with a promise that we would play gangnam style. Within seconds a dance floor was conjured from what had been a banquet only moments earlier. There had been a fantastic spread of everything a student could want: garlic bread, spag ball, party hats, veggie sausage rolls, vol au vents, pitta bread and a vat of mulled wine. I joke but Chris Pearson loved it! 
The raffle was a success, as always full of great goodies. Paul South and his family did snap up all the top prizes but what really grinds my gears is who ever chose those tequila flavoured beers, half drank them and then left them spread out round the room. By the time I drank them they were warm and had lost their fizz. 
The Hawk and I were dishing out the tunes and the crowd was lapping it up. Alice was getting her sweat on, Kylie was doing her tiny weeny dance, Lou Tonkin was running and then sliding on her knees, Cath  Cath was doing her thing, Ellie and Steve were doing the robot, Jack did his spinny thing over and over. The floor was packed; even the staff were getting involved, there was barely space left to fit Graham and his growth in . 
Jan turned the music down a few times. Think he was complaining about how many shapes were being thrown and there not being enough space to receive them .
You can guess how the game played out - the lightweights fell by the way side and only the hardcore were left. I was sent off for misconduct and at that point the men still standing were Ky Ho, Wilco, Laurie, the 2 Lads from the 4s and a half conscious Chris Pearson. I know what you're thinking - what an amazing indoor hockey team that would be ...
There was another game played that day. South took on City. The game had its highlights and its lowlights so here they are:
South shipped the ball across the back line confidently, often outletting through a swift push pass from Ed  Broyd. 
A personal highlight was Mark Williams dominating my university club chairman. I had shared a train with this guy back in September and I had tried to get him to come and join South but he had his heart set on City due to his boss's recommendation. Lets just say the sorting hat wisely showed him to City.
Richard Claes takes the ball at full stretch, he's already strides ahead of the last defender but the keeper is fast approaching. He drops his shoulder one way and then goes the other (I've seen it a thousand times before but I find myself in awe and slowing my run to a canter). He's round the keeper and the goal is gaping but the angle's tight!..I'd say he didn't realise quite how long he could have taken but the ball didn't find the goal.
City scored but in my disgust I erased this from my memory. 
We find ourselves in a familiar position of late, a goal down. McCulloch, Pearson and Claes were all misfiring, the team needed a hero and John Hawkes stepped up. Hawkes picked up the ball off a ricochet, calmly took it into the D and then released a belter. I refer you to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=0ZhysyhUL9k"" onclick=""window.open(this.href,&#13;&#10; '',&#13;&#10; 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;"">youtube</a> clip goal 5.
As if Johnny Hawkes hadn't done enough his next contribution came only moments later. I was shouting at him at the time when he picked up the ball near the half way line. He skinned 3 or 4 men before literally firing us in front with a reverse stick hammer.
Claes made it 3 and thank goodness he did as South went down to ten men and came close to undoing all their hard work.

The 2s had struggled all week to muster 11 players, and once a team had been rallied there was then the problem of sorting out how everyone was going to get up there. However, this was resolved on Friday night after a record breaking amount of emails (my hotmail has crashed) and team changes. 
Upon arrival at the ground the team discovered the public school facilities were awesome. The heated floor in the changing room delayed the warm up. If Ron would have been present there would have been a lot of swearing on his part to get us out and warming up with his 'Pepperpot' exercise, which is good, apart from the name of it, and surprisingly very confusing for people that have never used it before, such as Dave Monck and Andrew Fraser. 
Dom had created a team formation, so the IPad was produced to explain where everyone was playing. Quite fittingly it was a Christmas tree shaped formation. With 3 sweepers on the field, and a back four that wouldn't have looked out of place outside a nightclub entrance, it appeared that the youngsters would have trouble getting anywhere near our goal.
Unfortunately that didn't prove to be the case. The first half was a well fought out match where south didn't produce any real good chances on goal, and the Rutland team were well composed, passing it around well. The first goal was scored from a conceded short corner, from a controversial stick tackle by Dom. South were clumsy and the umpires were tiring of our countless stick tackles and foot fouls. 
At the half time break the formation changed from a Christmas tree shape to a Christmas sledge type of thing. We stepped it up a little and used the width a bit more which created some positive runs but yielded little in the way of good chances. However, South were still being clumsy in the wrong areas and more shorts had to be defended. The Rutland team were well practised in this department and it inevitably resulted in more goals. 
The second half efforts did provide some goal scoring chances. The best of all resulted in a Nick Venner classic, a 'take it round the goalie and pass it in' shot, this came from a superb lob pass from Tom Howell that travelled a great distance to successfully reach its intended target. 
Some decisions by the umpires were taking their toll on the south players. Bhav received a yellow for contesting a stick challenge, and Dom became increasingly infuriated, resulting in a display of aggression on himself on the floor. His hand bore the brunt and this resulted in not being able to pass to his right for the rest of the game. Surprisingly his stick, goal and dug out came away unscathed.
The last move of the game was an 'execution' style short corner by Rutland that sent the South team away with lessons to be learnt in composure, team play and clumsiness. It was obvious the Rutland schoolboys practice and play a lot of hockey together, with a consistent 11, resulting in an excellent display of 'Barcelona style' hockey, that we were no match for.
The 2s are going to have to work very hard to get out of the relegation zone they have found themselves in, going into the 5 week break.","Men's 2nds lose to Rutland 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

South had a fair few chances throughout the first half, good passing hockey all the way from the back created some good opportunities which were all but put away. South went in to half time feeling they should have been ahead. Some wise words again from Rick were taken on board and then immediately forgotten as the second half started. That said, the second half did start brightly with more chances being created by South. In usual 2s style they thought it best to concede a goal as doing things in a straightforward way would just be boring. South then came back quickly as if forced to hit the target after more goalmouth scrambles with 2 fairly quick goals from Russ and Dave respectively. The moment of the match was yet to occur. Nearing the end of the match with South still needing a goal to settle the match the ball fell to Anns outside the D. He jinked inside the D before unleashing what has since been dubbed the greatest strike of all time, it went cannoning into the post. Not long after the final whistle went. The next problem came at teas with a number of South players burning their mouths on the pizza, this problem was overcome wisely by master tactician D.Nelson who used the pick your piece early then wait for it to cool technique, a method that saw him reap the rewards.

The team reached the pitch late and we did not see the start of the Wale v Ireland rugby match but we still had an hour and 15 minutes for our game to start. 
When the game did start it was typical M1 - if we have the ball we will take it at least to the opponent D. Graham, Laurie & Rich were quick upfront and very well supported by John, Finn & Mark in the midfield. In the defence Dave, Chris, George and Bhav were phenomenal 
In the meantime Graham got a strike on his foot and was subbed. South looked like they lost a bit of the touch because of the extended winter break, but luckily Pbrough dominance didnt result in a goal. Well done defence but that was it. 
20 minutes gone, Pbrough scored from a ball that bumped on someones foot and came at waist height into the D; their striker (whom we later asked, is a phenomenal cricket player) hit the ball in the net. 1-0 Pbrough. 
Rich had different ideas and took the ball from his own half, went past 7 defenders and slotted the ball past the keeper. 1-1.
South did get a couple of PCs but we were unable to score from them. 
We had to improve our game in the 2nd half. 
The less said the better. After about 20 minutes the ball hit Bhav on his foot and he had to be subbed. (When will the South players learn, its hockey and not football?) Pbrough scored through this PC. 2-1. We didnt strike the Pbrough goal and test the keeper for the next 35 minutes. They scored again with 5 minutes left through a field goal. 
Game ended 3-1. 
M1 needs to score goals against St Neots and get some results go our way if we still dream about promotion.

Yes. Indeed. Where was our defence? Oh yes - on holiday.

This match was all about mis-understandings: 
	First there was Williams and Wych - misunderstanding the importance of committing to the team as they skived off, muttering something about weddings and skiing.
	Haslop apparently misunderstood the instructions about the start time, arriving at the pitch just a few minutes before push-back.
	McCulloch mistakenly (but understandably I'm sure you'll agree) believed Pearson was horrendously hungover from the night before and refused to pass him the ball for most of the game.
	The St Neots left-back misunderstood which team he was playing for, playing a perfect ball in for McCulloch to drive into the circle and smash one past the keeper for the first goal of the game after just a couple of minutes.
	Clearly disorientated by proceedings at the other end of the pitch, the Cambridge South defence then misunderstood which team the St Neots centre-mid was on, allowing him to dribble unopposed through their ranks and put the ball on a plate for the forward to tap in and level the scores.
	St Neot's left-mid however was less of a threat. After being thoroughly embarrassed by some Virtuoso-Virdi hockey skills, he forgot what sport he was playing and booted the ball away cynically, receiving a yellow card for his soccer skills.
	Aggrieved either by the wretched unfairness of it all (not quite their exact words...) or the superiority of the South attack and annunciation, St Neots' tempers were starting to flare. The flair on the other hand (sorry - I can't help it!) was all South's with shots raining in on the St Neots' keeper who to his credit had an excellent game (says the main shot-taker...;-)
	The umpire obviously misunderstood Finn's jovial and 'colourful' banter for something a bit more sinister and instructed the South captain to subdue Mr Johnson before he was sent to the naughty corner. After weighing up the pros and cons of Johnson being carded, McCulloch decided on balance it was probably just about within the team's interests to keep him on the pitch and so the necessary calming words were handed out. There may even have been an encouraging arm around the shoulder. Well ok then - around the waist. Who am I kidding...?
	Broyd and Virdi clearly forgot the rule about not showing up the regular 1st teamers, putting in classy and composed performances at the back, with Virdi also driving the tactics at the half-time chat.
	And this match-report writer clearly misunderstood the importance of focusing on the game as I know there was another St Neots goal in the 1st half but I can't remember anything about it. Lets just say it was all Average's fault shall we?
In the 2nd half there were still more misundertandings...
	Aston suffered a complete misunderstanding of the terms 'left' and 'back', choosing instead to hover uncertainly at the top of the opposition's circle, hoping to improve that 0.08 goals-per-game average he boasts.
	St Neots continued to be uncertain about what sport they were playing, with some impressive rugby tackles and footballing prowess regularly breaking down promising South attacks. Eventually an invisible line was crossed and another yellow card was handed out.
	Meanwhile Johnson misunderstood where he was on the pitch, shooting at goal from a good 30 yards out. He'll claim of course that it was deliberate and he knew the opposition defender would deflect the ball into his own goal. Either way, this slightest of touches (detectable only to one umpire and one spectator) gave a weary South team a lucky equalizer and provided the motivation to push for a winner.
But at last the misunderstandings ended. In what proved to be the dying seconds of the game, South finally gelled and created the move of the match, with nearly everyone involved in a quick interchange of passing that ended with Claes selflessly passing across the keeper for McCulloch to finish with the keeper beaten.

It was arguably a cruel way for St Neots to lose but it's hard to feel sorry for a team that give the umpires and opposition so much abuse throughout - and after - the match. 

There are now some big questions to be answered:
1.	Should new technology such as 'Snickometer' be introduced into hockey?
2.	How will South cope without the illustrious Hawkes for the next three weeks? (Might be interesting to compare to our performances in William's absence earlier this season...)
3.	Should South spend more time practicing hockey and less time writing match reports?","Men's 1sts beat St Neots 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",1

Undaunted by the lack of out-and-out centre forward or the DANGER - ROAD FLOODED - TURN AROUND NOW signs on the way to Wisbech, the pre-match banter was spiced with talk of over-taking the 1s and the possibility of promotion. A poor start and early goal by Wisbech woke some from their reveries and we soon realised the secret to winning hockey matches in north west Cambs lay not in passing the ball to the opposition or kicking it into the goal but in holding on to the ball and passing it from stick to stick. It was joyous to watch and as word spread throughout the town, the crowds started arriving to see these strange southern folk with their new ideas. Such an approach has no room for superstars - Total Hockey is a whole-team approach. This made identifying a man-of-the-match a tortuous affair as everyone played their part (Lemon of the Match was less difficult as Dom was playing). With Dave making strong runs down the right, and newbie Ian solid on the left, Colin and Rick controlled the mid-field, distributing the ball from left to right and occasionally right to left. Goals were inevitable with two for Nick and two for Rick. 
Post match analysis rightly focussed on the third goal - a visionary pass from Captain Ron nailed to the back post for Rick to control at full pace, round the keeper and rocket into the backboard. But this did not do justice to the feeling of shared satisfaction of knowing we had won because we did the simple things well for 78% of the match. Still unbeaten in 2013. Bring on the 1s.

Anyone who from time to time feels that life is passing them by should try taking the drive from Cambridge to Wisbech. The previous day I had driven 12 hours home from the Alps with no problems but on Saturday, stuck behind a beet lorry for what seemed an eternity, I was sorely tempted to throw myself into the huge dyke that runs along the side of the road (no, not Aston's mother - I mean the river thingy). 
At the request of <strike>Kylie</strike> Graham the match had been brought forward an hour from 15:30 which meant that Wisbech could not supply two umpires and Jan kindly offered to travel with the team to ref the game - thanks Jan.
As I remember it, the match went a bit like this:
<ol><li>The first 10 minutes were nip and tuck with both sides probing through midfield but creating few opportunities.</li><li>Then Wisbech pressed further up the pitch with a sustained spell of pressure and scored from a flick when Paresh was adjudged to have made a stick tackle on an attacked about to shoot on goal. Soft.</li><li>South were being beaten to the ball in midfield as Wisbech marked tightly and held the ball well. They scored again when the South defence got pulled out of position, leaving the centre forward unmarked to slap in a good shot past Steve Parker.</li><li>Wisbech then scored a fluke third goal when one of their veteran players attempted a flailing reverse stick cross from the left byeline and fluffed it, only to see the ball slide through the narrowest of gaps between Parker and the post to go into the goal</li><li>After half time South played some nice hockey and spent a lot more time in the opposition half and similarly scored a fluke goal when Aston attempted a flailing cross from the right byeline and fluffed it, only to see the ball balloon up off a defender's stick and loop into the goal. That was Aston's second goal of the season, both scored at the Wisbech pitch; they probably think that he is a player to be feared .....

Perhaps the scoreline was a bit harsh on South but in truth the opposition played the type of hockey that we want to play ourselves - quick, sharp team play and confident, decisive shots on goal</li><li>Loved the journey home.</li></ol>

Could there have been more riding on one match? That was certainly the thought of the umpires, and quick thinking from Mr Brynjolfssen in ensruing a prompt 12 noon pushback meant that league rules were followed to the T. Rumours that Graham had requested the push back to be delayed in order to get one final good luck kiss were unconfirmed.
South did start brightly however and some early pressure yielded a short corner. Time for South to unveil their new original routine, stop it dead, and whack it in. Highly effective. This gave Paresh his first goal of the season, and leaves him one shy of about 200 people in the club defenders goal king race.
South continued to press in the remainder of the first half and played pretty well, constructing numerous attacks and winning several corners.   One of these led to the second goal- shame it came at the wrong end. A cross into the Rutland d was cut out, and they countered with pace before rounding Steve and slotting a cool finish between Gravelings legs.
Half time the message from captain Graham was clear, continue doing what were doing and the goals would come.  South came out and scored immediately after the break.   I cant remember it in too much detail but do remember it was an epic goal, finished by an all round decent chap.   So well done whoever you are.
Third goal was another great move, again I forget how it was finished but as Jack scored it I imagine the twirly spinny thing was involved: even if it wasnt it sounds more interesting in the match report.
4th goal was definitely good.   PP owned the Rutland attacker with an on your knees block tackle special, before looking up and putting in a perfect Mousa Dembele style pinpoint pass from behind the halfway line straight to the Ginger Ninja in the D, who wasted no time in putting a first time finish past the Rutland keeper.
The opposition were pretty disheartened after this, and there was time before the final whistle for a fifth, with another bustling team move being finished by Snooker under the keepers body, having waited very patiently on the P spot for the best part of 5 minutes to finally receive the ball in order to do this.
All in all a good performance, probably our best for about 3 months or so.  Three wins from the last five games will see our best total ever, but that elusive top two finish will probably have to wait for another season.  ","Men's 1sts beat Rutland 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

The dedicated bunch that did bother to make the trip were rewarded with a glorious sunny afternoon and an easy 6-0 win. Some of the lads even found time to pop to the beach, presumably they had assumed the journey had taken so long, it was now summer!
Those that didnt make it to the actual beach didnt miss out; the pitch was so sandy it was more or less the same thing. This unfortunately meant that South were unable to play their preferred style of free flowing champagne hockey and were forced to get down and dirty in what was to be a scruffy battle with only the odd moment of quality. 
South didnt have to wait long for the opener which really settled any nerves and set them on their way to dominating the possession. It came from a cracking move through the heart of the pitch, the key moment being Haslops one touch pass at the top of the D to the right wing that split the defence. The ball was fired back in and Laurie was on hand to deservedly get the final touch.
South should have pressed home their advantage but Vice Captain Williams decided to get himself sent off instead to keep things interesting. Apparently, its ok to point out an umpire has made a blatant and horrendous error but one should do it quietly and without swearing.
Exactly 6 minutes later, after absorbing some promising Alford attacks, South burst down the left wing with the hard working Pearson releasing Gareth Bale . .. No sorry, Graham McCulloch who skinned two players for pace and burst into the area. The keeper, mistaking our skipper for a small child, inexplicably shouted out come to Daddy, Finn quite rightly took the piss, Graham scored and hilarity ensued. Obviously upset that he had been mocked by Finn the keeper threw his stick, helmet and glove thingys down and sprinted up to the half way line to remonstrate with the cocky Johnson. Sadly when he got there he was exhausted and nothing happened, much to the disappointment of the South team who were looking forward to watching Finn get a slap.
South ended the half 2-0 up, a fairly comfortable lead, the message for the second period was  to make the drive back as enjoyable as possible by sticking a few more goals  past Finns new friend and (apparently), Grahams Dad. 
The third goal came from another scorching run by McCulloch into the left channel followed by some nifty stick work, followed by a pass to Halsop on the goal line, followed by some pathetic brownnosing, followed by a tap in for McCulloch. 
Goal 4 was a peach, a short corner routine that worked like the clockwork found in the finest Swiss watch, McCulloch to Chalk, the ball stopped dead, like in the good old days, Johnson to Williams to Pearson to backboard, all in the blink of an eye, sweet as!
Pearson scored the fifth as well, although the jury is still out as to whether he deserved a second goal or not. Played through into the D Pearson bravely dinked the ball past the overly aggressive keeper who was only interested in taking him out. The keeper was rightly sent off, as was Chirpy McChirpyson who somehow thought it wasnt a peno and gobbed off Williams stylee. There was no doubt Pearson had earned the right to score the flick which was taken against a kicking back with no pads on - I questioned earlier whether Pearson deserved a second goal because his flick was slow, right down the middle and about half an inch below testicle height - a baggier pair of shorts would have won Pearson a unanimous lemon vote.
Williams picked up the sixth and final goal with a delicate lob over Alfords third keeper of the day, who for the record was fully padded up and, although very short, was unrelated to McCulloch.
Its worth adding that although unmentioned above, debutant Oli Culley, Dom Nelson and George Wych had great games in defence, Parker made some vital saves and Chalk was involved in much of Souths good work down the right.

The Snow Patrol confirmed that despite the good winter (or Bon Iver as the French would say*) extending through March, the pitch was good to play on. South were as usual very Keane to get playing but lacking in some organisational skills - some arriving at the pitch an hour early but having failed 2Pac a single hockey ball between them had nothing to do but stand around Counting Crows** until the others turned up.
South started with purpose and there was an Air of composure that had been missing in the other top-table match against Wisbech. Some surging play down the right inexplicably found the sweeper Graveling in the attacking D where he tapped the ball through to McCulloch who slotted home past the Newmarket keeper to give South an early lead. There would be no Levellers for Newmarket this time though as this was quickly followed up by a 2nd goal for South. Having established a New Order for attacking short corners, the Asian Gentleman stepped up and did what he does best, even making it look easy in the process. Why oh why did we only discover this at the end of the season?!
The Pendulum had definitely swung in South's favour. Newmarket now faced an uphill battle. The rest of the 1st half was a bit of a Blur. South maintained their discipline with The Calling for balls and general sharpness on the ball causing the Newmarket defence continued problems and some Tenacious D* defence by Wych, Parsot, Graveling and even Aston keeping the opposition at bay. Parker was Sublime in goal, and The Feeling was that this was South's game for the taking.
The Prodigy that is Claes, starting on the bench (entirely unrelated to his suspicious absence from the long-distance trip to Skeggy last week...)  duly entered The Fray and soon made an impact. By this time Haslop had decided to Embrace the tactic of using up time by just bouncing the ball off the keeper while the seconds ticked away. Claes was having none of it though, clinically dispossessing Haslop, dragging the ball back and lifting it over the keeper's Elbow to make it 4-0. 
South were starting to have Fun and The Doors of the Newmarket defence were beginning to creak. A Massive Attack down the right found the Asian Gentleman marauding forward with the D in his sights. Parsot fired in a trademark bullet of a diagonal cross which was finished off by McCulloch with a trademark deflection into the top corner that wouldn't have looked out of place in The National leagues. At the other end, Newmarket racked up a record number of short corners but couldn't convert any - most of them being described by their own defender as Garbage.
Graveling, Hawkes and Williams also inadvertently added to the fun-factor. First Hawkes managed to turn a straight forward passing opportunity into a squaerial in the One Direction we didn't need it - straight off the side-line. Then Graveling kicked in Newmarkets only goal, skilfully deflecting a wayward short corner strike back into the goal off The Shins just when it looked like it would be a clean sheet for South. Not to be outdone, Williams scored South's 5th goal with considerably more 'finesse' than was needed, selecting his sand-wedge to chip the most delicate of lobs over the floored keeper.  The post-match theory is that the back-spinning ball must have then bounced off a stone which gave it enough momentum to creep over the line before a defender could reach it.
Much less fun was had by one of the Newmarket defenders who gained a couple of extra joints in his index finger after putting it in a stick sandwich as he tried to stop a McCulloch reverse-stick strike. A quick glance at The Kinks in his finger left No Doubt that it was well and truly broken. We wish him a speedy recovery!
Afterwards, dining on a tasty chicken curry flavoured with some (yup - you guessed it) Red Hot Chilli Peppers in the Oasis that is the Newmarket Working Men's Club, South could only Muse on the lack of Justice that sees them comprehensively beat a team that will almost certainly be promoted instead of them. 
All in all a fantastic team effort with some great goals - Five for Fighting hard, exactly The Cure we needed for our confidence issues. In fact the only down-side to the whole thing was this horrendously lemon-worth match report that The Editors will surely reject...

This game against Peterborough was an important one in the road for survival, and both teams turned out strong squads for the game.
The team was without its illustrious captain Ron for this one, he didn't even make it to the ground to shout at us from the side line. He suffered an injured thumb from last game and opted for umpiring the 1st's game. 
Having beaten Peterborough 3-1 away earlier in the season South were confident, however their opponents turned up with some additional quality to the team they fielded in the previous game. The first 15 minutes was a very good spell despite the strong team South faced, where some good passing and fast attacks brought some excellent chances. Russ Johnson had the pick of the bunch but was unlucky. We also had a string of shorts where Tom Howell (playing his penultimate game for South) was on form with his hitting, but the keeper was solid and blocked all efforts.
For the last part of the first half south were put under pressure and Peterborough won a few shorts themselves, but did not convert any. Dom Nelson was putting up another solid defensive display along with Olly Culley, Tom Anns and Rich Morgan and a Peterborough goal looked unlikely.
The second half was quick paced and there were break away chances at both ends. Tom Howell managed his 'once a game' lob pass that he almost launched out of the ground, but it failed to clear the fence. Dom had Peterborough's best shot of the game, almost beating Shabaz, but all it did was make Shabaz look awesome and earn him man of the match for the save. 
South were first to score, it came from a short corner half way through the 2nd half, following a previous short where Tom H powered the ball into the keepers thigh, missing his pads and winding him. Maybe this put him off for the following short, which he stopped but didn't clear and Ian Small pushed in following a goal mouth scramble.
Unfortunately South only held their lead for a few minutes before conceding a short which Tom Anns saved on the line, if only he saved it with his stick instead of his foot! Peterborough slotted home the resulting penalty flick.
Nick Venner and Ian small had a couple of good chances before the final whistle, but a draw was probably the right result in a good natured hard fought match.

Nomads have had a rough time of it over the last couple of seasons and it really shows. For everyone's sake I think its best that we don't dwell on this match.
However, Chris Pearson did finally get the hat-trick he'd been desperately seeking of late, three well timed deflections taking him to seven goals in the last four games. We'll ignore the fact that the umpire had already blown for a short-corner when Chris scored his first - and then inexplicably and very generously allowed South the goal anyway. 
Paresh also scored from another fine short-corner strike. A goal-a-game defender - now that's better than Average... 
At some point in the second half, as Steve's eyelids were beginning to droop, the defence kindly let one Nomads attack through to ensure Steve woke up and got at least one touch of the ball. Other than that it was all one way traffic, systematically broken down either by the Nomads sweeper's feet or by South's own eagerness to Dribble All The Way To The Goal. In short, the result was never in doubt and the fact that only four goals were scored may be attributed to the fact that South's other two attacking work-horses, Rich and Laurie were both absent; Rich unbelievably because he was on a Hen Do, and Laurie apparently suffering from a near-fatal bruise.
Incidentally, this win takes us past our previous best-ever points total in Div 3NW. This is officially our best ever season. So at least there's that.
In hindsight, the Red Bull match teas were probably the highlight, with mountains of pizzas followed up with more left-over birthday cake (thanks Georgie!) than we could possibly eat.","Men's 1sts beat Cambridge Nomads 2","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Confidence was high after hitting double figures in both pre-season friendlies, although there was a niggling doubt about the playing level of our opposition in both those matches.
Those doubts were quickly confirmed. Bourne Deeping 3rds are their clubs youth development side, following the common lads-and-dads set-up of four adults dropping down from higher levels in key positions down the spine of the team, with teenagers operating off them. They were well drilled in defence and in moving the ball around. It arguably took South a whole half to come to terms with the work they needed to do in midfield and defence to beat a team of this standard.
That said, South, despite seeing less of the ball than Bourne Deeping in the opening hlaf, did carve out the majority of the chances. David hit the post twice, first when he swept Rob's cross against the far post, and then late in the half when a deflection off a defenders stick saw the ball spin in slow motion onto the other post. David also had a chance from a short corner, directing his shot towards the far post as per the routine, only for the post-man to be awol from his task of making the goal big, so the ball flashed wide. Stu, up from right back, also had a chance when he found himself unmarked in front of the net, but he couldnt quite get a stick on the cross.
In amongst all this, the visitors took the lead. A pacy dribble from midfield carried the ball into the South circle. The initial shot was saved by Parky, but the rebound fell to one of the Bourne Deeping midfielders coming up in the second wave, and he cracked a crisp shot into the far corner. They had another chance when Souths substitutions lead to mass confusion and numerous players unmarked (this wasnt the only time such a thing would happen), but fortunately Parky bailed us out on that occasion, so the sides turned around with Bourne Deeping 1-0 up.
South began to assert themselves in the second half, support runners offering themselves and less direct passing finding them, as we gradually pressed the play higher and higher up the pitch. The equaliser came in the aftermath of a short corner. The initial routine was smothered by the Bourne Deeping defence, who then brought the ball out of their 25, only for Matt to tackle the player carrying it clear. Matt was then able to thread a ball through the advancing defenders to pick out Rupert, who had found an unmarked spot in the circle. When Rupert had controlled the ball and turned, he found himself with two options; shoot or pass square to the skipper. Opting against passing in such a situation is not necessarily an error, but it does come with a caveat; if you choose to ignore your skipper, you had better bloody score. Rupert did so, beating the keeper with a flicked shot inside his near post side.
We were 2-1 up soon after; the move began with a sideline hit on halfway on the right-hand side. The ball was switched across the pitch through the defence and then up to Jelley to Ali, in acres of space on the left. Ali drove into the circle, the ball running loose to Rupert, who worked himself a little bit of space and flicked the ball goalwards. It wasnt the paciest shot ever hit, but what it lacked in speed it made up for in bobble as two despairing defending sticks missed the bouncing bomb.
South continued to look the more likely scorers, with Rob going close when he rounded the keeper, only for his shot to be cleared off the line. So it was little surprise when the lead was extended to 3-1. It came in the aftermath of another short corner (which didnt really work today, we need to practice them more, I think). Johnny Bs initial shot was well saved by the keeper, and a defender tried to whack it clear. The ball was airborne, and was pulled down spectacularly on the reverse stick (by someone sorry, Ive forgotten who!). Rob took the loose ball, and went for Barton Goal type 2.1, with Pike, onto the reverse, hard sweep into the far corner, land on his arse. Beautiful (the goal, not the arse).
With five minutes left, that should have been that. But, seemingly believing the job was done, South switched off from the restart. Once again, as with the first half substitutions, people were unsure where their man was. Rather than going to the nearest free man and working out the marking structure once the opposition formation was clear, we stood around gormlessly marking no-one whatsoever. Bourne Deeping made three or four simple passes, which carved us open with embarrassing ease, culminating in an unmarked player on the far post turning the ball into an open goal. Im sure they regard it as a well worked goal, but we did nothing to impede them scoring it. With that, panic set in. The last five minutes saw Bourne Deeping laying siege to the South 25, with the ball being won by the defence and then quickly lost again as we struggled to clear our lines. The final whistle came as a relief.
So, finally, we should mention the record, i.e. the club record for consecutive wins. The M2 held this for their storming run in spring 2011, winning 11 on the spin as they gained promotion from Division 4NW. Well now, the last time the M3s collected something other than three points from a league game was 26/11/11. From then on, it was 10 consecutive league wins to claim the Division 6NW(s) title. There were also a couple of friendly match victories thrown in (do they count?). Having won both our pre-season matches this term (no, really, why dont they count? I sure the M2s would be including the September 2011 friendlies in their run, if not for the irritating 2-5 final scorelines... ;-) ), we went into todays match on either 10 or 14 consecutive wins. Which is now 11 or 15, depending on your persuasion. Victory in the derby match next Saturday against Nomads 3rds, and the arguments cease. Nomads, derby and a record to chase. We wont lack for motivation chez Abbey next Saturday.","Men's 3rds win their first game back in Div 4 v Bourne Deeping 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

It was clear from the opening phases that we had a very good chance of success in this game, as we penned Nomads back for extended periods. The early pressure was soon converted into a lead, through a familiar source, the Barton reverse stick*. This one wasn&rsquo;t quite archetypal, as it didn&rsquo;t involve the old sweep-and-topple. Rob remained stubbornly upright throughout, drawing the &lsquo;keeper towards him and then reverse flicking it past him to roll home.
A two goal lead was established within the opening fifteen minutes, and in this case it was the timeless classic. James, making his South debut and looking a very handy player, feed the ball into Rob near the top of the circle. Rob had a defender at his back, so shifted left to find some space, swept on the reverse and then barrel-rolled as the ball *thunked* into the far corner backboard. Despite intense pressure for the rest of the half, the goals then dried up. This was due in part to some excellent play from the Nomads &lsquo;keeper, in particular two saves to deny Matt, but was also attributable to wastefulness, as we took the wrong options when we in promising positions.
It was a good way into the second half before we scored the third goal that put the result to bed. The creative moment was Matt&rsquo;s intelligent pass against the grain, feeding the ball in to the left wing when the flow of the move had previously been Lib Demish, i.e. veering rightwards. Paul, who had just entered the play in place of Ali for a rare chance up front, was in acres of space. With the Nomads defence unable to turn in time to deal with the unexpected angle of attack, Paul was able to advance on the &lsquo;keeper and flick the ball into the far corner.
Nomads were a sporadic threat on the counter-attack (although without ever managing an actual shot), but with a three goal cushion we could relax as one goal back wasn&rsquo;t going to seriously alter the complexion of the game. Maybe this is what allowed left-back Jan far enough upfield to play a defence splitting through-ball to Paul. The &lsquo;keeper saved Paul&rsquo;s initial shot, but Jacob was on hand to bundle the rebound over the line from close range, via the feet of a defender and the Nomads goalie.
It looked like we were going five up when Rob collected the ball in the circle and set himself up for the reverse sweep, but then almost unaccountably dragged his shot wide. Where was the Swiss watch precision normally provided by this move? Was this hattrick jug avoidance on an epic scale? Such speculations were quickly dismissed as Rob got a near carbon copy chance after a pass in from Jelley on the left flank, and this time placed it smoothly into the far corner.
Our final goal came in the aftermath of a Yaya Toure-esque upfield burst by sweeper Johnny B (or Beckenbauer-esque, for the benefit of older readers). Having arrived at halfway, he laid the ball off to Rob and continued running, Rob returning the ball to set Johnny clean through. Unfortunately for his hopes regarding the goal-of-the-season award the &lsquo;keeper kept out the shot. The Nomads defence swept the loose ball clear but not far away, as Jacob retrieved it near the right touchline, from where he crossed. This was arguably not the most sympathetic cross ever hit, as it came in hard and at chest height. No bother for Matt, who calmly dropped the ball to his feet, and then flicked home off the inside of the near post.

South&rsquo;s ULO (the man responsible for the &lsquo;volunteering&rsquo;) and Nomads 3rds skipper owe her a little, I think.","Men's 3rds thrash Cambridge Nomads 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

The performance, especially in the first half, was the best we have produced this season, apart possibly from the six-goal salvo in the first twenty minutes of the <a href=""<http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-1-sept-2012.php#M3>"">opening friendly against Stortford 5ths</a>. In fact, that Stortford side and Newmarket today are two of the better teams we have faced. It seems that a good opponent forces us to raise our game.
As against <a href=""<http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-22-sept-2012.php#M3>"">Nomads last week</a>, nerves were settled by taking an early lead. It came from the usual source, the Barton reverse. A good team passing move saw the ball worked up to <a href=""<http://991.com/newGallery/Roy-Orbison-There-Is-Only-One-445975.jpg>"">Roy Orbison</a>, who feed it in to Rob, posted up with a defender at his back. As we know, this is when Rob is at his most dangerous, as he worked himself some space on reverse, and then cracked the ball into the far corner.
Soon after, it was 2-0. It came from the first short corner conversion of the league season, the ball being shifted wide and then played back in as per the routine. Rob didnt fully get hold of his shot, with the ball spinning towards the near post. There was some debate afterwards whether this was goalbound (didnt look like it to me), but Oli wasnt standing on ceremony, making sure from close range.
Newmarket then held us at bay for a while, and indeed were causing problems of their own with their willingness to commit players to the counter-attack. Perhaps the stretched game this created was what led to a number of balls out of the Newmarket backline being intercepted, putting us into some very promising positions. From one of these situations (actually more of a tackle, but the pass went into a player under heavy pressure) Matt was rampaging through the centre. He eliminated the final defender and slid Rob in; Rob drew keeper and then knocked it past with, yes, youve guessed it, a reverse stick sweep.
As the first half was winding down, we made it four. This was a neatly worked set piece, a free-hit outside the 25 in the right channel which James slapped towards the far post for left-winger Tom, arriving on the run, to sweep in. Good goal. There was still time in the half for Jans cross from the right to just be too far ahead of Jelley as he attempted to stretch on the reverse stick and turn into in an empty net, and for Newmarket to utterly open us up, as they worked their centre-forward clean through, only for Chris to race off his line and make a good smothering block.
The half-time chat was along the lines of Well, that was good, lets keep it going, whilst also acknowledged that the defence were playing high and occasionally getting caught out, but this was probably worth it because we were creating chances as a result and were likely to score more than them playing this way. Of course, Newmarket were also pondering the opening half, and made some alterations at the break that changed the pattern of the game in the second period. These seemed designed to limit the damage, withdrawing some of their livelier forwards into holding midfield roles. As a result, the game became a little bogged down. We had a significant edge in territory and possession, but were finding too many bodies in the way, leading to some less efficient passing than earlier. Mind you, there were still chances being carved out, and it would be churlish not to point out that the Newmarket keeper was excellent during the second stanza.
We got the scoreboard moving again inside the last fifteen minutes, with our second short corner conversion of the day. The simplest of variations this time, as David found the target with a well-hit straight strike from the top of the circle, aided by a deflection from a defenders stick. That looked like the end of the scoring, until Newmarket forced a short of their own with less than five minutes on the clock. Similar to Davids goal, it was converted with a well hit straight strike, pinging into the far corner.
Whilst Im sure it provided a psychological lift to the visitors, some may question whether <a href=""<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRWZ3xLnWk4&feature=fvwrel>"">disturbing The Kraken</a> is completely advisable. We were suddenly faced with only drawing the second half, a serious disparity with the first, which would have left a bit of a flat aftermath. Fortunately, being goaded into action just showed the current resilience of the team, as two more goals were fashioned to give the match a more satisfying conclusion, at least from our perspective.
The sixth came after a good advantage by the Newmarket Umpire, letting play run after a foot as the ball broke to <a href=""<http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Terminator-2-judgement-day.jpg/250px-Terminator-2-judgement-day.jpg>"">The Terminator</a>. He fired an angled cross towards David on the penalty spot, who swept it past the keeper on his near post. In the last minute, it was seven; this one came in the aftermath of a short. David had the first shot, which the keeper kicked clear as far as Matt at the top of the circle. Matt gathered and flicked for the top corner, drawing a glove save from the keeper, the ball running loose along the right byline. Tom raced after it, and crossed on the swivel (only 180 degrees, Jack wouldnt even get out of bed for that) for Rob to deflect with the reverse stick, the ball just making it across the line before the covering defender could reach it.
7 league goals from Barton, 7 from the reverse stick. Just sayin...
The final whistle blew before the game could restart, leaving the final analysis at 7-1. Later in the evening we found out the true worth of those late goals. Previous leaders Louth won at Grantham, but only by a solitary goal, meaning we have taken over top spot by virtue of a goal difference that is better by one.
Talking of Grantham, we welcome them to Chez Abbey next week, for the first ever meeting between the two clubs<sup>1</sup>. New opponents, but not all new people. According to <a href=""<http://www.granthamhockey.co.uk/>"">their website</a>, Granthams vice-captain is recent Southerner Benjie Groom. Benjie can legitimately claim to be the king of Div 6NW, having played <a href=""<http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/teams/mens-3rd-xi/history/mens-3rd-xi-season-201112.php>"">last season for South 3rds</a> as we won <a href=""<http://www.east-leagues.co.uk/showdata/EML%20tables%201112.asp?division=6NW%28S>"">Div 6NW(s)</a>, before transferring to Grantham midway through their <a href=""<http://www.east-leagues.co.uk/showdata/EML%20tables%201112.asp?division=6NW%28N>"">Div 6NW(n)</a> Championship campaign. We look forward to seeing him again.
<sup>1</sup> - how do I know South have never played Grantham?

The first issue prior to this weekend was an unusual one; too many players. 59 people were available for selection across the Men&rsquo;s club, with at least half a dozen others who play most weeks being unavailable or injured. This prompted some to openly speculate about a South 5th Xi. For me, this is chimera; it so happened that today&rsquo;s matches were all in the city. We will see how numbers stack up when some of the sides are playing outwith Cambridge.
After the skippers had moved their pieces around on the 
<a href=""http://www.liverpoolwarmuseum.co.uk/images/toppics/maproom.jpg"">big board,</a> El Capit&aacute;n found himself with a matchday squad of 16. A bug would reduce this to 15, but even so a suggested soundtrack for this report is <b>
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU6CnTqXLfc#t=0m18s"">Mahler&rsquo;s Symphony of a Thousand</a></b>.
The Mahlerian metaphor is pushed a smidgen beyond reasonable limits if we use it not only with regards to the size of our ensemble but also as a stylistic allusion to our first half performance. Bombastic, with a very full orchestration, all sections contributing. At times slightly lacking in subtlety and wholly fresh creative ideas? Hey, those are <u>your</u> criticisms of Mahler, not mine.
With 
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapellmeister#Contemporary_usage"">Kapellmeister</a> Ali having included himself amongst the Orchestral players for this performance, it fell to principal guest conductor Katja to keep time and cue the various changes as laid out on the Maestro&rsquo;s meticulously prepared score, her first such gig this season after having been a regular feature for concert goers in the previous season&rsquo;s programme. Maybe we should work under her baton more often as we produced a sweet music, dominating the first half.
The tone was set early, from a free-hit thirty yards out, wide left. Neil was scanning around looking for some movement and found it with timed burst from James. By collecting the pass whilst going at full speed, James was through the Grantham midfield line and able to pass in to Rob in the circle. It was a bit airborne, but Rob dealt with in manner of a cricket batsman neutralising a ball that rears-up at him 
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekD_TMvInIQ"">nice straight bat, high, soft hands to absorb the energy and drop it at ones feet</a>. Rob&rsquo;s second touch moved it onto the open side, and his third drilled it home.
Our second goal came from a trio segment; the rest of the players taking a brief pause as the left-sided threesome worked their little melody. A sideline hit was won 10 metres from the byline. Ali put it quickly back to Neil on the 25. Neil jinked inside a player and fed it into the circle for Rupert. Rupe carried the ball away from the goal and then reverse-stick flicked it behind him for Ali, who was running the overlap. Ali now had a clear view of goal, albeit from a very narrow angle. Exercising Maestro&rsquo;s prerogative, he took the shot, and it was pitch perfect, finding a gap of hardly more than a ball&rsquo;s width between the &lsquo;keepers pads and his near post.
Our third goal came as the result of some jazz freestyling from right-back Jan. Exactly what he was doing in the attacking circle during open play was a question that orchestra 
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concertmaster"">leader</a> Johnny B wanted answered. Whatever the reason for this improvisation, Jan was on hand to follow up with a reverse stick push into the open net after the Grantham &lsquo;keeper had saved an initial reverse stick sweep from the lesser-spotted Barton.
We ended the first half ended with a fourth goal. Or a crescendo, depending on how far you have bought into this riff... The opportunity was created by hard battling in the Grantham circle from Stu, eventually prising the ball away from a defender. Stu then flicked a shot towards the far corner, with Rob getting across the front of the &lsquo;keeper to add a little outside edge that left the gloveman clutching at thin air [at least I&rsquo;m consistent in my mixed metaphors here: Rob/cricket, the rest of us/music. And you can definitely draw parallels between classical music and cricket, and not just because both can feel like they are going on for hours without development].
The second-half would prove a little 
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4C5T4rq5AU"">more strident and discordant</a>. Our play lacked much of the rhythm heard in the opening movement, with the tempo dropping and as a result the structure of the piece was lost. We did add a fifth goal when a Grantham short broke down. James collected the loose ball in our circle and did precisely the right thing, getting his head up to play an early outletting pass, hard and accurately to halfway. One good pass, and suddenly we had a six-on-three break. Jan received the ball out and slid it on to Tom, who found Rob in the circle. Rob pulled right to move the &lsquo;keeper and buried his shot into the left corner.
Grantham got a consolation goal late in the game. A quickly taken free-hit caught our defence 
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNA-XfduSE4"">daydreaming</a>, giving the space for a cross in from the right which found an overload around the penalty spot, Grantham&rsquo;s unmarked centre-forward finishing the move with a sweep past Chris. We had one final chance from a short corner that was worked back to the Maestro. His deflection was saved, the rebound fell to James, whose flick across goal clanged off the far post and away. So it finished 5-1, after a bit of a

[blimey, that was hard work to write. How was it to read? I&rsquo;m not going for this style of report again, I promise! I ran out of classical music analogies and had to go more &lsquo;popular&rsquo; at the end. For shame.
Hello, has anyone actually made it this far?!?]
And now onto the part of the afternoon that left a bitter taste. There was a substantial amount bickering between the sides and dissent towards the Umpires. This culminated in the unedifying sight of one umpire fleeing the pitch at the end of the game close to tears, having felt thoroughly undermined by the level of criticism.
<p>From our side, some of this came from people who like to think they know the rules, but could really do with attending an umpiring course. There have been numerous opportunities for them to do so in their years playing for South, which have been passed up. Which is a shame because, if they did, they might;</p>
<ol>
<li>
	learn the laws of the game that they are currently willing to inaccurately pontificate on, and</li>
<li>
	actually have a go at Umpiring and so discover just how difficult it is to whistle a game. Which might prompt them to bite their tongues when, in their opinion (and the offenders are mostly wrong when they are moaning), an Umpire makes a bad decision.</li>
</ol>
A couple of other people, senior umpires of the club, might also want to consider whether half-time or full-time of a difficult match is really the appropriate juncture for a discussion over rule interpretations. Or whether chatting to the umpires in such circumstances is likely to be interpreted as criticism and will actually put a further dent in confidence.
All in all, sincere apologies to Shahbaz and Vicky. You offered your time to help us out, and that is how we repay you? Not classy.","Men's 3rds v Grantham 1 : Awaiting Result","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Not only our first game beyond the fuzzy embrace of Cambridge, or indeed away from the Abbey, it was going to require one of our longest away trips and that to take on a side relegated from 4NW last season. There was some nervousness in the cars on the way up, although that was mostly confined to Joe after Tom had threatened to be sick in the back of his (borrowed) vehicle. The slight feeling of trepidation wasn&rsquo;t helped by a look at Boston&rsquo;s pitch, which was liberally splattered with mud. It looked... agricultural. The opposition from a previous game kindly pointed out the areas that were particularly treacherous underfoot. Remaining upright would be an issue, but seeing as none of us had packed any suitable footwear (ice skates would be one suggestion), we were going to have to make do.</p><p>The game opened up with Boston looking quick on the attack. Not really that much of a shock, as one member of our team had complained they looked worrying young and enthusiastic. That this comment came from Tom, still a teenager himself, was a bit perturbing. Our attacks were of a slower build variety, but they were still looking dangerous, and in fact we took an early lead. Tom made the most of a good advantage from the umpire to feed the ball square to Matt. Matt threaded the ball through a minuscule gap between two defensive sticks for Rupert, who steered it wide of the &lsquo;keeper and into the far corner.</p><p>In the following minutes, we had our chances to extend the advantage. If we had done, maybe the game might have followed a different pattern? We will never know, as a couple of decent chances from short corners went unconverted and other promising situations petered out. The failure to put a gap on Boston was clearly an issue, as their pace up front was proving something our &lsquo;experienced&rsquo; defence was finding very difficult to handle. An equaliser looked certain when &lsquo;keeper Chris was rounded, but somehow Neil managed to cause enough of a nuisance for the open goal not to be banked by either of the Boston players on hand. One of the home players was heard to exclaim &ldquo;How did we not score that?!?&rdquo; Well, quite...</p><p>It would prove a temporary reprieve as another attack burst into our circle. The forward lost the ball, but two defenders chasing in his wake couldn&rsquo;t pick it up as their momentum took them sliding past. In fact the quarter strength contacts that the defensive sticks got helped tee it up perfectly for one of Boston&rsquo;s next wave, who put a slapshot inside Chris&rsquo; near post. Slightly fortuitous in how it had actually occurred, but it would be hard to argue that an equaliser wasn&rsquo;t coming.</p><p>The second half followed a fairly similar pattern to the first. We probably had more of territory and possession, partly as Boston chose to sit their defence pretty deep, but of the two forward lines the hosts looked much the more dynamic and penetrative. In fact, the flow of the game can be summed up by the short corner count, which I made 7-1 in our favour, and by the source of Boston&rsquo;s go ahead goal; one of our shorts! We messed up our routine and gave away a free-hit. This was quickly taken, launching a 6-on-3 counter. Despite an attempt to slow them down in the middle of the field with a surreptitious foot, the attack reached our circle before any of our hastily retreating short corner unit could offer assistance, meaning that the Boston centre-forward was unmarked on the penalty spot to sweep into an open goal.</p><p>We now had to chase the game, which left more space for Boston&rsquo;s dynamic attackers to exploit. Such was the source of their killer third goal, as a player weaved past two men, got himself into the circle for an unmarked shot, and put a wrister high past Chris&rsquo; glove side. Both teams kept looking for goals in the final minutes, with Boston probably going the closest, but that was the end of the scoring. And of the winning run. *sob*</p><p>And so it was on to the bar to ponder what will hopefully be a rare loss, and to try our best at consuming the vast spread our beneficent hosts had laid on for teas.

The introspection threw up the following (not a Tom reference); we no longer have a 100% record, or the leadership of the division. But at least it gets easier next week, as we return to familiar surroundings to take on... oh... um... the only team who <u>are</u> still at 100%, St. Ives 3rds. Like Boston, they were relegated from 4NW last season. Still, Barton should be back for this one, which means his teammates have no excuses or opportunity to place the blame on a convenient scapegoat.

Possibly their best decision was, from our perspective, irritatingly spot on; disallowing Matt&rsquo;s rising shot from a short corner on the grounds that that a sweep is more like a slap-hit than a flick. Which would have put us 2-1 up, if they had given it. But that would have been a mistake...

[dear reader, please skip if pushed for time!]
This game had stood out in the calendar as the two sides began the season with a run of victories. A little of the spice was removed from the contest by our defeat at Boston last week, meaning it was 3rd vs 1st rather than a top of the table clash. However, that loss did add extra pressure to the game; a defeat would leave us six points behind St. Ives and would also mean we had gone from winning regularly to losing two on the trot. The famous <a href=<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Lombardi>Vince Lombardi</a> aphorism about winning being habitual is not actually the whole of what he said, which was Winning is a habit. Unfortunately, so is losing. Losing is not a habit we want to acquire, so making sure we didnt follow one defeat with another was essential.
Before launching into a description of the game, a little historical context; for South 3rds simply to be facing St. Ives 3rds is unusual. The Saints have spent most of the last decade in 4NW, with just a single season excursion to 5NW in 09-10, when they bounced straight back up as runners-up. We, on the other hand, have mostly been playing in 5-7NW in that time. When facing St. Ives club it has usually been against their 4ths or even 5ths. Hell, most of South <i>2nds</i> contests with <a href=<http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/stats/rivals/rivals-breakdown.php#StIves_M2>St. Ives down the years</a> have come against their 4th Xi! The Saints havent particularly regressed in the intervening time. That we were meeting them on even terms shows how far we have developed as a team (and club).
That said, the one previous season when South 3rds and St. Ives 3rds did coincide, the aforementioned 09-10 campaign, came at the current high watermark in South 3rds history; 6th place in 5NW. And it so happens that, despite the Saints finishing 2nd in that league against our mid-table spot, we had the better of the matches between the sides, <a href=<http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-200910/reports-14-nov-09.php#M3>1-1 at their place</a> and a <a href=<http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-200910/reports-27th-february-2010.php#M3>4-1 win at the Leys</a>. Given the current St. Ives 3rds side went into the game still boasting a 100% record, there was a fair amount to live up to.

<u>The Game</u>
After an opening few minutes of sparing, we began to look dangerous and carved out the first clear-cut chance of the match. Tom went on a dribble down the right channel, knocked the ball past the full-back and made a lung bursting effort to get to the ball before it went over the byline; having reached it, he was confronted with attempting to cross whilst on the full-sprint, a difficult skill but one he executed well, firing the ball across the face of goal. Ali, arriving from his wing, made a diving attempt to deflect the cross in, and was unlucky to see the ball come back off the post.
Soon after this, we went ahead, through a fairly similar move. Rob managed to break up some passing by the Saints defence near halfway, getting in to jab the ball past a flat-footed defender. Having rode the defenders robust attempt to play the (long-since gone) ball, Rob was running towards the Saints circle. The keeper came out to meet him, Rob jinked right to go around, but found the angle narrowing too much for a shot to be the high percentage option. Instead, he showed his customary cool and clear thinking in the circle, bringing the ball back onto his reverse side, and crossing to the far post to give Ali a finish into an empty net. That the Barton reverse stick was key was a clear source of irritation for certain St. Ives players; Rob had a spell playing for them a few years back, and often for Saints 3rds specifically. Possibly this was the source of the shout along the lines of For Gods Sake! Dont let Rob onto his reverse. We know that is all he has! Far be it from me to argue, but he has scored some goals front-stick as well, you know. Maybe not as many, but some...
The opening twenty minutes would prove our best spell of the match, on top in terms of territory, possession and chances created. This stemmed from repeatedly winning tackles in the midfield, which was disrupting the Saints ability to outlet from the back. However, when the visitors did cross halfway there were worrying signs of the potency of their front line. The one thing we didnt need to offer them was a helping hand. Unfortunately we did precisely this when, with our defence in possession and fairly high up the pitch, a square pass was misplaced and got away from its intended target. The Saints player reacted quickest to the loose ball, and one won tackle produced a 2-on-1 break. The execution was clinical, draw the last man, make the pass and fire the clear shot into the far corner. 1-1 and a distressingly soft goal from our point of view, especially as with it the game had changed and our early momentum was lost.
The teams turned around all-square, but as the second half progressed, the Saints begun to look more and more threatening. So it was somewhat against the run of play when we went 2-1 ahead. It came from that age-old source, the Barton reverse. It seems knowing about the threat and being able to stop it are quite separate things. This goal, Robs 11thin five league appearances, came after his initial (front-stick) shot had been saved by the Saints keeper. The ball ran free near the left post, and Rob was more alter to the opportunity than the defenders around him, reverse-sweeping with a little lift over the despairing stick of the diving keeper. Such is our confidence in his finishing, I swear some of us were celebrating the goal <i>prior</i> to Rob actually taking the second shot.
However, this was merely an interruption in the visitors best spell of the match. Shahbaz, guesting between the sticks for us, saw a number of shots off, and also had a couple of very close things whistle past his goal. The Saints may even have forced a short in this period (there were hardly any in the match, one or maybe two for the Saints, more for us but probably only five maximum). Rather than shorts what they got was much more influential; two goals to move them ahead for the first time. The equaliser came from a ball that squirted across the circle, with the Saints winger arriving from wide out to sweep it home. The 3-2 goal was the best of the match. A ball into the circle for the centre-forward posted up, who deflected it across into the path of a late arriving runner. Despite this player having to slow from a sprint and balance himself, he was able to launch a first-time reverse stick strike into the roof of Shahbazs net.
The game was beginning to get increasingly fractious, especially in the areas containing our front-line and the visitors defence. Our guys were complaining that they were receiving no protection from what they regarded as overly robust tackles that came through the man. The Saints were retorting by suggesting that our front players were causing offensive obstructions, backing into them. Both teams were making the Umpires work for their supper. This all culminated in an incident where James had the ball, back to goal on the top of the circle. As he tried to create space for a reverse stick drive, the Saints defender nicked the ball clear. James determination to get a shot away was such that his swing continued, crashing across the defenders shins. A collective gasp went up, and the incensed defender had to visibly (and sensibly) restrain a desire for retribution. The umpire called James across and to our relief issued only a green card, having deemed the challenge to have been a genuine attempt to play the ball, horribly mistimed, rather than anything malicious. Fortunately, the card appeared to do its job, as the game cleaned up noticeably in the aftermath.
Time was ebbing away, with the visitors holding on to their narrow lead. Either the closeness of the score or the pace of the game was having an effect on their midfield, who began to hold position rather than support their forwards. This meant that when the Saints crossed halfway we had them well outnumbered and were able to turn the ball over with increasing ease and return it to the areas of the pitch where we needed to play.
Pressure was growing, but we were into the final minute before the strain was sufficient to induce a failure. Ali came across the pitch from his wing, and cracked the ball into the circle. It deflected off a defensive foot on the way, but fell within reach of Rob who swiped at it (his own words) and got just enough of a connection to take it through the Saints keepers dive. Rupert was on hand behind the goalie, to collect the loose ball and push it into the open net... except it took two goes, the first push home having somehow been stopped on the line by a desperate defender, with Rupert forcing the loose ball the final few inches. Scrappy as hell, but it counted for rather a lot. How close we had come to two straight defeats was emphasised by the final whistle coming as the ball was being returned to centre. We had scored with less than ten seconds remaining. *phew*
Results elsewhere in 5NW today were interesting. All 12 sides scored at least 2 goals, with four of the matches finishing all-square. It suggests that, six weeks into the season, everyone is up and running with their game. One of the two matches that produced a decisive outcome saw Louths unbeaten record end, which meant our hard-earned point was enough for us to overtake the Lincs Wolds side and move into second place in the Division. Next week we got to Bourne Deeping 4ths. Which isnt going to be easy, but we do need to start winning again, because another way of putting that Lombardi quote, one that works outside America where they dont do draws, would be Winning is a habit.

Well, there were problems in the build-up. No regular goalies being available. Numbers down, resulting in some people playing despite niggling injuries they might have preferred to rest. Final Xi not exactly being balanced in terms of preferred positions (defenders were particularly thin on the ground). The alignment of the stars, maybe? But those are <i>excuses</i>, and they dont really wash. Everyone we had on show would be selected for the 3rd team when available; none of the people playing should find Div 5 a struggle. Simply we were collectively below the standard that we can reach, facing a Bourne Deeping side who were easily good enough to exploit the situation. The better team on the day won, and comfortably so.
Enough moaning, I hear you cry, what about the action? Well, the hosts took the lead fairly early on, exploiting some hesitant defending inside our circle to cross for an unmarked player to finish easily. We drew level when Jan intercepted a pass and fed Rupert. He played a ball into the circle which the keeper looked favourite for; however, Rob doesnt give up on things like that, and he managed to get a jab on it just prior to the clearance kick. There was no need for an additional touch, the jab trundling gently into the net. Bourne Deeping went back ahead when one of our 16s was cut-out, producing an overload and an unchallenged shot of the sort that Neil had told us pre-game we couldn't allow to happen. Unsurprisingly, it went in.
Our brightest period was early in the second-half, as we actually managed to string together some passing, including our best move of the match. The ball was transferred quickly between four players, moving the play upfield and from one side of the pitch to the other so giving space for Andrew to drive in a cross; a defender attempted to block it, but it sliced off the end of his stick and hit the post. So close to an own-goal.
Then came the defining period of the match. First, Bourne Deeping exploited a maladroit piece of defending to earn themselves a short. They slipped it away from the runners, towards the post guarded by a defender who happened to be one of those out-of-position guys; consequently no pressure was applied to the forward, who had all the time in the world to wind up and give Neil no chance. We should still have felt competitive at 3-1 down, even if coming back to win was now unlikely. However, the way heads went down suggested that belief was absent. The result was a fourth Bourne Deeping goal straight from pushback, neatly flicked into the corner on the reverse stick, and a fifth a handful of minutes later as a player was able to dribble into the circle and crack a shot into the corner. The contest had been decided in a spell lasting less than five minutes.
It could have become (even more of) a rout at this point, but at least we manage to get ourselves back onto some sort of even keel. A goal was pulled back when Olly picked Jelley out on the 25, and he nutmegged a player to find Rob in the circle. Rob pulled onto his reverse and finished the chance (which kind of goes without saying). Bodies were being pushed forward in desperation at this point, which resulted in more threat to our goal than it did to the home keeper. Neil pulled off a number of saves, including one from a high ball that any of our regular keepers would have been proud of. But he could do nothing about the chance in the final minute that made it 6-2, as a ball was first directed against his post and then the forward reacted quicker than the defenders to the rebound, flicking it home.
Our worst defeat for two years, and possibly the sign of a worrying trend, as we once again came unstuck in a match outside Cambridge. We were missing players and felt the lack. This is something we must rectify in our next away game. Which is (checks fixture list) at Louth. Oh. The longest trip of the season, and they are also the new leaders of the Division. Well, its a challenge to be met. First things first, though, we really need to get back to winning ways soon, hopefully starting next saturday when we host Wisbech 4ths. But lets not be too negative. Our good start means that we are still 4th in the Division and only three points from top spot despite the recent wobble.

We looked the stronger outfit in the first half, and opened up a two goal lead via the usual source. The opener came when Rob pounced on the loose ball in the circle, and hammered it (strong side) into the far corner. Rob doubled his and his sides tally with a reverse stick sweep that deflected multiple times off Wisbech players on its way home, including a desperate attempt to clear off the line that only succeeded in finally knocking the ball in.
It could have been three when a sweeping move involving Olly and Chris W sprung right-winger Tom Anns clean through. Tom committed the keeper and slid it past him... and wide of the far post. Pity. [For any second teamers reading, yes, really, Tom played up front. And he looked pretty lively up there as well. Who knew?]
We opened the second half looking to put the game to bed, but the third goal never came. In fact, as the half progressed it began to look that if the scoreline was to change, it was more likely to be Wisbech who did so rather than ourselves. The last ten minutes saw them camped in our half of the pitch, getting into shooting positions and winning shorts. It needed the calming presence of Chris between the sticks, dealing coolly with the efforts Wisbech put on target, to keep the scoresheet blank.
And, well, not a great deal more happened. The defence and midfield held up well until those panicky last ten minutes, but our attacking moves petered out repeatedly in the last third. Not exactly vintage stuff, but 3 points is 3 points. It keeps us involved at the right end of the table, 3 points behind leaders Louth.

Increasingly desperate appeals were not eliciting any more willing adventurers, and we were within 30 minutes of the committees deadline for forfeiting the game before Rasmus and Simon agreed to step up from the 4ths to help out. Thanks guys, we owe you one.
Simply to get a team together was an achievement, winning the game would be something else again; our two previous trips beyond the boundaries of Cambridge had resulted in defeat, and Louth (which is on the same latitude as Sheffield and the southern edge of Manchester, fact fans) is no ordinary away game. They are the leaders of Division 5NW and boasted a 100% home record with 21 scored, 2 conceded. Not the most obvious location to get the travelling form moving, then.
The first half saw Louth have the majority of territory and possession, swinging the ball around at the back, looking unsuccessfully for gaps in our defensive organisation. They also possessed some dynamic dribblers who were able to go past tacklers, but by working in small groups rather than as individuals we were slowing these players up and then turning possession over. By contrast, our first serious foray upfield saw us take the lead. It stemmed from a free-hit, centrally located just outside the 25. Matt declined the direct ball into a crowd, and instead went square to James out on the left flank. James played a low hard drag in to Rob, in the circle but wide of goal. Rob collected and caught the home keeper out with an early reverse-stick sweep (what else?).
The next major development was an injury for Matt, who took a powerfully struck ball on the foot at close range. With only 11 players travelling, and Matt initially not able to put any weight through the appendage, things looked bleak. Everybody put their heads down to do the work of 1.1 men. After a few minutes on the sideline checking for broken bones and icing the developing bruise, Matt return to the fray to rejoin teammates who had mounted a successful rearguard in his absence, with Louth having only managed a couple of shots that looked potentially threatening but proved wayward. There was speculation after the game that this period actually <i>helped</i> the team, as it demonstrated the levels of effort and commitment we could achieve.
Having turned around with a narrow lead, the next goal was likely to set the pattern for the rest of the game. It wasnt long into the second-half when we got it. Rasmus crossed from the right for Rob. As per, he went for a reverse-stick sweep, but for once didnt connect quite right. The ball looped slowly towards the keeper... and past him. After a brief pause whilst everyone processed the evidence from their eyes, the realisation dawned that we had lucked into a bit of a gap.
Our best spell came in the next few minutes. We had the most territory and possession of any stage of the game, maybe getting these metrics as high as 50/50. Such numbers are of little relevance in comparison to the scoreline, and it was nearly 3-0 when a goalmouth scramble saw Rob and Ali both denied by desperate last-ditch blocks. Disappointment was short lived, when a couple of minutes later Ali intercepted a ball near halfway, and set Simon free down the channel. Simon drew the keeper and squared to give Rob an open goal. Converted, incredibly, with his front-stick.
By now, Louth were openly frustrated by how things were turning out. Their most talented player had taken to trying to dribble through us on his own, but weight of numbers repeatedly frustrated him, sometimes legally, others not so much. Our defence maintained its organisation, putting on its best showing of the season. For all Louths dominance of possession, they had failed to register a single (legal) shot on target so far in the match. That finally changed from a short corner in the dying minutes; the defence disrupted the routine, but not enough to turn the ball over. Mr Dribbly ad libbed space for a shot, which was kept out by an excellent save from stand-in keeper Johnny B. However, he was unlucky that the rebound fell straight to another Louth player, who hammered home. No clean sheet, then. Pity.
Conferring with the umpire told us only 2.5 minutes remained, so it was hold what you have, as exemplified by Rob, who deliberately cracked the centre-pass upfield and off the pitch near the Louth byline, eating up a few precious seconds. Cynical, man, cynical. Louth did get the ball back to our end in the remaining time to earn a shortie, but didnt force JB into further work. We had won! Our 6th victory from 9 games, coming from probably our most disciplined performance of the season so far. We are on 19 points, level with Louth and St. Ives 3rds at the top of the table, although currently in 3rd spot on goal difference. Hopefully this can be a springboard for the rest of the campaign.

After riding out a rocky opening spell, with Ely taking the majority of possession and pushing us back towards our circle (that the opposition wants to win and will run about in an effort to achieve this often seems to catch us by surprise), we took the lead. Ali intercepted a pass on halfway, and then made quick use of the turnover ball, feeding David in the left channel. David passed on to Rob in the circle, who swung left and drilled a reverse stick shot across the keeper into the far corner. Its not dj vu if you have, in fact, seen it before...
Being ahead settled us down, and we began to put our game together. The lead was extended with a move that began when Neil set off from a free-hit awarded on the 25 near the left touchline. Neil went past his man to get to the byline and then picked out David in the circle. David moved it on to Rob, the ball arriving at roughly the same time as an Ely defender; from the challenge the ball ran loose, dropping kindly for Rob, five metres out and facing a hopelessly isolated Ely keeper. That the driven shot went in was almost a given. That Rob didnt even bother switching it to his reverse side, despite having time enough to do so, was more of a surprise.
Glossing quickly over an attempt on the reverse by Rob, which to paraphrase the man himself Didnt go as I was planning, there were no serious alarms for either keeper in the rest of the first half. At our end of the pitch this was testament to the work the side was putting in, as Ely were no mugs. In fact, we had got through another 35 minutes against a lively front-line without them managing a shot on target, which is very encouraging stuff.
The early part of the second period follow the pattern of much of the first, both teams probing away without working either keeper too hard. A piece of individual magic was needed to change the score, and it came from Andy. He collected the ball inside our 25 out on the left touchline, and promptly ran the line all the way into the Ely 25, beating their right winger, right midfielder and right back in turn (they helped a little by each player going in one-on-one, a very honourable display of <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry"">mook chivalry</a>). With his full-back beaten, the Ely sweeper was forced to come across and engage, opening up room in the centre of pitch. Andy pinged an accurate reverse stick pass to Rob, who had pulled into the vacant spaces at the top of the circle. Rob had time to set himself before clipping the ball past the keeper.
Ely then had their most threatening period of the game. Partly due to them pushing more players up out of defence as they had little to lose, partly as our intensity dropped slightly with the feeling that the work was mostly done, the net result was keeper Johnny B, again guesting between the sticks, being called into serious action for the first time. He produced two saves in quick succession from flicked shots, and then blocked a driven short corner strike and was relieved to see the rebound slapped narrowly wide. When a further short was flicked high towards the right post JB and the post man went for it, but couldnt keep it out (in fact, certain teammates have claimed it was heading wide, and the South defenders actually pulled it back into the goal!).
We were wobbling a bit at this point, especially when JB was called on to make another quick-fire double save, but then managed to nip the nascent Ely comeback in the bud with a 4th goal. This one was all Stus own work, stealing the ball in a tackle, advancing the short distance into the circle and cracking an early shot in at the near post. This was notable for two reasons. Firstly, the trouble Stu had been having hitting the ball in the first half, with a number of poor connections. But not when it mattered. Secondly, it was our first goal since <i>20th October</i> from someone other than Rob, who had netted our previous <b>ten!</b> It is nice to know that we do have other goal threats in the team...
Our confidence was up for the remaining minutes, and the chances started flowing. One move saw Ali set David clean through on the keeper. David aimed for the far corner, and put it ... wide. 30 seconds later David was back through again, this time opting for a reverse stick flick which again beat the keeper and also again beat the far post. No matter, as Tom was then off on a dribble from inside his own half. Having jinked past the first tacklers, he was met by an Ely defender who happens to be a teammate from Hills Road, and who seemed to have him under control until Tom did him with a spin move. Tom advanced into the circle, played a one-two with David and then beat the keeper at his near post.
We ended the match with a sweeping move that culminated in David squaring for Olly to flick goalwards. The shot was smothered by an impressive diving save. Unfortunately for Ely, this was affected by a defender rather than their keeper, with a penalty flick the result. Olly took responsibility as it was his shot that had earned the opportunity, and found the target left-of-centre.
The match finished 6-1, which in truth flattered us a little. We certainly deserved the victory, we created the majority of the chances and ours were clearer-cut than Elys, but it never felt like a game that would produce a 5 goal victory margin. Our one period of true dominance, the final few minutes, allowed for some gilding of the lily. As the top of Division 5NW is extremely tight, with ourselves, St. Ives 3rds and Louth all on 22 points, goal difference is clearly important and those late goals enabled us edge closer to St. Ives (who won 4-0) and make useful ground on Louth (who won 2-1). Currently the GDs read St. Ives +26, Louth +25, South +20.","Men's 3rds beat Ely City 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0
1429,"24/11/2012","League",3,122,"15:30",7,"Away","5","0","1","0","False","False","False","We went into this game knowing that victory would lift us into a promotion place as the two teams who began the day above us, Louth and St. Ives 3rds, were only ahead on goal difference and were playing each other. We nearly began the process within ten seconds, as an attack from the opening centre-pass produced a chance for Tom, whose shot rang the far post. Our enterprising start continued, with the Saints keeper forced into a number of early saves, and our opening short foundering when a player seemingly about to tap into an open goal couldnt get his stick out from under his feet.
The early momentum was in danger of dissipating unrewarded when we took the lead from our third short. The ball was worked around as per the routine, with Rob slapping a shot that the keeper kicked away. Tom prevented the clearance exiting the circle, and flicked into the far corner. Well, I say Tom scored; Rob made a concerted effort to claim this goal, saying he had challenged the keeper and definitely got a touch on something, probably the ball, as it went past. The team considered Robs already potentially decisive lead in the <a href='http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/teams.php'>Goal King standings</a>, raised a collective eyebrow, and noted the goal down as Toms.
The rest of the opening half was much more even, as the Saints found their game and began to give as good as us, though in truth neither keeper was over-taxed in this period. We had gone into the match with a slight tweak in formation, playing 4-4-2 instead of our usual 4-3-3, mostly due to the preferred positions of the players who had travelled. 4-4-2 had worked recently at Louth, but this time we found ourselves lacking width. It was especially noticeable at long corners, with takers devoid of options. As a result, at half-time we switched back to 4-3-3 in the hope that we could get around the back of the Saints more often.
With a slender lead the next goal was potentially vital, and we nearly gifted it away. A quick counter-attack down our left had caught our midfield beyond the play, and when the ball was centred Jan came across from right back but somehow contrived to miss the simple pick-up. This left <i>three</i> Saints players clean through. Fortunately for us / Jan, the Saints forward who collected possession had apparently lost his bearings, as he inexplicably took his shot from at least a foot outside the circle, allowing Chris to calmly lift his foot and let the ball in. This was apparently heart-stopping for the rest of the team, watching on from the other half...
Having survived that scare, we went 2-0 up with a move that benefited from the extra width of playing with three up. Neil dribbled down the left line and picked out Ali, now out on the wing. Ali moved it on to Rob, cutting in from the left near the byline. Rob advanced on the Saints keeper and looked like he was going to switch reverse, which had the effect of making the goalie cover his near post. This allowed Rob to round him on the strong side, and then flick past the defenders covering on the goalline. Was the aborted reverse stick shift a dummy or a change of mind? We will never know, but whatever prompted it, it worked.
Two was quickly three, with the best goal of the game. A free-hit in central field and just outside the 25 was taken by Paul. Instead of firing it directly at goal and into the crowd, Paul picked out Tom who had pulled wide right (call it family instinct). Tom received and relayed quickly and hard towards the near post, with Rob making a run across the front his marker to get a deflection that gave the keeper no chance. Ball speed, sharp movement from players hitting space as the ball arrived, and patience and vision to work around the defence rather than going due north resulted in bang, bang, goal; 5 seconds of play that should be the template for the whole team.
At this point the game was obviously won, with the enthusiasm of the home team ebbing away. To be fair the weather was terrible, very cold, windy, and veering between heavy rain to full-on downpour, with enough coming down to leave a sheen of standing water on the pitch from the outset (though not enough to affect the run of the ball). Dispiriting stuff, and then one adds falling behind... For around ten minutes the ball barely crossed halfway, and we took advantage to add gloss to the scoreline. A sideline pass from Ali sneaked over/past/through a defensive stick to put Matt in the clear; he advanced into the circle and slipped it past the keeper and home. Ali then added his name to the scoresheet when he collected the rebound from a save and connected solidly with 50% of the ball for a close-range push that bamboozled the goalie.
The Saints made a stand at this point, giving us no more chances in the remaining time but not particularly threatening themselves; I think everyone involved was glad to finish and get back inside to dry out and warm up. Once in the bar, we heard that the clash of the top two had finished 3-2 to Louth. Which leaves us 2nd. The top of the division is very congested (see below), and goal difference, even goals scored, may well prove important in separating teams. For that reason, this win and last weeks <a href='http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-17th-november-2012.php#M3'>6-1 success against Ely</a> were very pleasing. They represent the heaviest defeat either team has had so far this season, the 11-1 aggregate closing a goal difference gap on the teams above us that had been the equivalent of  point off our total.

However, the brave (and shivering) 12 gathered at the meet to hear that BD had been in touch to declare that the pitch was already perfectly playable. No chance of some surreptitious Christmas shopping, then...
On inspection, the pitch was as described, although it sounded rather hard underneath. Not a day for diving deflections (does anyone do those in Division 5?). BD 3rds are their clubs youth development side, with 4 adults and a cast of teenagers around them, and they brought the expected style for such teams; well structured hockey, moving the ball around the back, continually probing for gaps in the opposition defence. Our game was a bit more direct, relying more on early feeds up to the front men and slipped passes in higher areas of the pitch. The approaches more or less cancelled each other out in the first half. There were dangerous situations in both circles, but nothing more than half-chances for either team.
It opened up a bit in the second period, and it was the hosts who created the first clear cut opportunity. A typically well constructed attack outmanoeuvred our defence to the point where their left winger received the ball, unmarked, at the top of the circle. Johnny B proved more than good enough to kick his shot to safety. It was only a temporary reprieve, as a well worked short put BD ahead; the receiver played a one-two with the right slip man, flicking the return ball first-time high into the net. Somewhere close to undefendable.
Given the lack of clear cut scoring chances we had created, it was looking grim at this point. Fortunately, we got a break to get back into the game. James played a hard pass upfield which Andy deflected on to Tom, just outside the circle, back to goal. Tom considered his options, and went for a 180 degree spin combined with a dragged release into the danger area (I believe the technical name for this move is a Half-Chalk). The ball departed Toms stick ~50cm outside the circle, hit the foot of the nearest defender and then took another couple of wild ricochets off defensive sticks/bodies before thumping into the goal. An own goal, the first in our favour [Nobody ever found out if <a href='http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-1st-september-2012.php#M3'>Neils OG against us at 11:20 on 1/10</a>, i.e. the day the rules change, was the first in all of Britain, did they?].
Our tails were now up, and we soon had the game turned on its head. A counter-attack down the left flank involving Ali and Tom fed the ball into Andy in the circle, posted up. Andy twisted and shot, the keeper saved, with the rebound falling for Tom who scrambled home on the reverse stick. Soon after, there was a chance from a short corner to extend the lead. The routine went awry but fell nicely for James; his shot on the turn flashed narrowly wide of goal.
The main question was whether we could keep BD out? The answer turned out to be No, an equaliser coming from a direct flick from a short corner. The ball went high but then arrived at Johnny with nasty dip and essentially yorked him. Paul, on station behind his keeper, got a stick on the ball, but couldnt stop it. After the match, both players expressed disappointment that they hadnt kept the shot out, which was taking self-flagellation much too far in my opinion. Dealing with a ball bouncing right at your feet is a truly tricky thing for a keeper to deal with (there is a <u>reason</u> why a well executed yorker is one of the most difficult deliveries for a batsman to keep out), and for Paul to have controlled the ball as it suddenly appeared was a 1:100 chance at best.
Our hopes for re-taking the lead took a blow when Neil, defending right under the Umpires nose, ended a BD move with a deliberate foot. Out popped the yellow card, our first sin-binning of the season. The ten men held out for the remaining few minutes comfortably enough, and we even had the greater attacking threat through dribbles from Tom and Andrew in this period, but they came to nothing and the match finished all square. Probably a fair result on balance. It ended our recent winning run, and only time will tell if it represents two points dropped or one point gained, but for now it keeps us second in the table.","Men's 3rds draw against Bourne Deeping 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",1

During an innocuous passage of play, Matt tripped over and hit the ground, with the ball running free to James ten yards further back. James unleashed one of his hard dragged passes upfield, straight onto the Kern posterior. Whether he was trying to make some kind of point about the size of certain objects or something similar is unknown, but in Matts words He even lifted it a bit to make sure it connected.
Having composed ourselves from the mirth this incident caused, we scored two goals in quick succession to move into a comfortable lead. The opener came when Rupert worked his way around the outside of the Nomads defence, getting to the byline left of the goal. From there he pulled the ball back to Matt near the top of the circle, who put the chance into the far corner with an accurate flicked shot. Our second came from Jans ball in from the right flank, which bounced off a Nomads foot into space near the penalty spot. The Nomads keeper came for it but Tom just got there first with his reverse stick, touching it past the goalie and home.
Towards the end of the first half Tom made it three when he forced in following a goalmouth scramble (OK, so Ive forgotten exactly how this goal happened, my only mental image of it is something like <a href=""http://www.danoah.com/wp-content/uploads/cartoon-fight-dust-cloud.png"">this</a>). Nomads are enduring a hard campaign during which they are yet to win and have only scored five goals, so the game was essentially settled at this point it was just a question of how many. It would turn out to be a few more, but not as many as we might have hoped.
The next goals also came as a pair, but took nearly 20 minutes of the second period to arrive. Ian fed Tom down the right, who crossed into the circle. A Nomads defender deflected the ball, only for it to fall perfectly for Simon, who put it into the near bottom corner. This was Jelleys first goal this season, which explains a celebration that appeared slightly over-exuberant for the 4th goal in a simple victory over the bottom side. Though, to be fair, we are talking more <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtWO1jUpvM4#t=98m15s"">Tiger Tim</a> than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRZ0cQUbpuc#t=9s"">Marco Tardelli</a> here. Four was quickly five, the chance being created by a good cross-field pass from Neil, out on the left flank, to find Tom lurking unmarked near the right of the circle. Toms shot was saved, but Rupert collected the rebound and flicked into the empty net.
We then went onto hiatus again, and it wasnt until the dying embers of the game that the score was added to. Tom was once again the source, putting a cross-shot in towards the far post with Rob applying the finishing touches by diving to deflect in with his reverse stick. That it had taken nearly 69 minutes for Rob, the top scorer in the club and probably also in this division, to gets his name on the scoresheet during a lop-sided game caused some amusement on the sideline. It was nearly seven straight from push-back as Tom dribbled into the circle and then repeated the trick of aiming for the far post (why did it take us nearly 70 minutes to work this one out, btw?), this time with a clearly deliberate cross that skipped past Ruperts stick when he had seemed certain to tap in.
Despite the seemingly emphatic win, the team were quite disappointed with their performance. The ball rarely left Nomads half and only entered our circle once, with Steve, guesting for us in goal, not getting a single touch all game. So, nearly constant pressure and only six goals to show for it. We were rather too direct in our approach play, repeatedly attempting to go through the centre of the Nomads team. When we did deign to use width, we scored. With the top of the Division being very tight (one or two points could conceivably cover the top four sides once re-arranged matches have been played), goal difference matters and we missed an opportunity here to builds ours up significantly.
<u>Nerdy Statistics Time</u>
Right, with the mid-season break now upon us (see <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/bsbvdn8"">here</a>), a chance to take stock.
The main headline is that <b>we are top of the league! For now...</b> A surprise defeat for Louth saw us leapfrog them, but whether we eat our turkey as league leaders depends on the outcome of a re-scheduled match, Boston vs Bourne Deeping 4ths, next Saturday. But even if we are not top come the re-start in January, we will be 2nd. Pretty encouraging, either way.
In historical terms, this is as good as it has ever been for South 3rds. The team has never been above Division 5NW, with the previous best record from a 22-game season coming in 09-10, W8, D5, L9, GF43, GA39, Pts29, which was enough for 6th spot. Our record so far this season is 9-2-2 51-20 29, so equalling or surpassing all the old marks already. In fact, we matched the previous best for wins and goals scored (8 and 43) after just 11 games...
Finally, 2012 as a calendar year has been a standout one for us. Our overall record from 21 league games and four friendlies is 21-2-2 117-29. We won every game we played from New Year (in fact the winning run dated back to December 11) until mid-October, a sequence of 15 league matches, 19 overall including friendlies. There are a bunch of club records from all this that will stand for a long while.

Some players break from hockey had been longer than others, though. Whilst most of the squad were regulars from the opening half of the season who had last tasted league hockey in December, this match saw the return to goalkeeping duties of Lino the Cat Di Lorenzo, on the pitch after a mere 46 months out resting a back injury. Welcome back to the fray, mate.
We went into the game with a new formation of 4-2-3-1, the result of some deep tactical analysis from Herr Commandant. A shield in front of the defence and a platform to play off was the idea. And it worked a treat, especially in the first half. Players were always available, allowing us to move the ball around as well as we have done all season. It is good to have an additional option to the 4-3-3 or 4-4-2 we played pre-Christmas. 
We were creating chances, putting a number of shots on the Saints goal in the opening twenty minutes, beating the keeper on a couple of occasions only for defenders covering on the line to block the shots and swing the ball away. The home side were trying to get the ball upfield more rapidly, hitting into their (excellent) centre-forward, who would hold it up and spring runners bursting from midfield. If this wasnt necessarily creating as much as us, when it did come together it looked very threatening. In particularly, one swift counter required some sprightly action from the Prodigal Returned to smother, Johnny B sweeping the loose ball away. 
It was somewhat against the run-of-play when the Saints took the lead. It stemmed from a straight strike from a short corner that Johnny B cleared away off the line. With his left foot. And his right, for good measure. Penalty flick, clinically dispatched. Our reaction to this set-back was obviously important, and within five minutes we were level. Some crisp passing worked the ball up to Rob in the circle. His shot was saved by the keeper, but the attempted clearance from a defender was intercepted by Joe, who wasted no time in firing an undercut across the keeper and into the far top corner. Sweet. 
That was all the serious action for the first half, with the half-time message being that we were playing well, if we kept moving the ball as we had done the chances would come. As it turned out, this happened sooner rather than later. Less than two minutes into the second half, JT made a tackle on a Saints defender to turn the ball over on halfway. JT fed The Somnambulist, clear down the right channel. Tom showed good peripheral vision to detect Rupert racing up in support, and took advantage by drawing the keeper and squaring the ball across the face of goal. The pass wasnt quite perfect, being slightly in front of Rupe, but that just made the diving reverse stick conversion all the more spectacular. Two opposition mistakes exploited with well-taken goals. 
Rather than push on, our ambition got a bit limited after this. Or possibly the Saints upped their work rate in search of an equaliser. Either way, the second half became rather a rearguard action. We struggled to clear our lines at times, but at the same time did a decent job of preventing the Saints from creating too many clear-cut opportunities. They certainly had some, and we rode our luck as shorts went unconverted and open play shots passed narrowly wide of both posts. That said, I cant remember a shot on target that Lino had to save (I can remember a shot off-target that was saved and which fortunately was put wide on the rebound by the forward following up. After that long out, we can forgive Lino for not exactly having his bearings yet). 
As time wore down, things got a little heated. Matt and a Saint had a coming together in midfield, followed by an aggressive confrontation that needed Umpire intervention to restore calm. Soon after a Saint turned sinner as he reacted to a foul from Andrew Wouldnt-Say-Boo-To-A-Goose by threateningly raising his stick towards him, and received a green card for his attempted intimidation. Their frustration was evident but we were keeping our cool, clearing our lines and doing a decent job retaining possession where possible. In fact, in the last ten minutes, our counter-attacks looked the most likely source of any further goals, with a number of near things from Ali, Rob and Tom. That wasnt to be, but the two we had had proved enough. 
Having gained what could prove to be key win, along with the three points received for last weeks bloodless coup over Boston, our position currently looks decent.

OK, maybe something slightly more verbose...
This match went wrong from the beginning.
The first set-back is outlined in the Lemon-of-the-Match award. We did manage to start the game with 11 men on the field, but those 11 didnt include a keeper as Lino was still only half kitted up. Fortunately we won the toss, meaning we had push back. This gave us a chance to set the tone, as if we could play keep-ball for a couple of minutes then we would ride out a tricky opening. It <i>was</i> set, as after 3 seconds and 2 passes, the ball was in Bourne Deepings possession. The next 90 seconds were panic stations as we scrambled to defend, gave away fouls and saw the ball stuck in our half. We were fortunate not to give away a shot or a short in this period, and it was a great relief to see Lino enter the fray.
Being back to a more usual line-up would see us change the pattern, right? Wrong. Despite the pre-match talk about how we needed to release passes early to work around Bourne Deepings strong tacklers, the ball was repeatedly run into contact and we were playing hugely narrowly.  It was, frankly, a mess. To make matters worse, Bourne Deeping were having no such problems, moving the ball off tackle situations to players standing deeper in space, who distributed the ball about, launching attacks.
The other pre-match warning that went unheeded was about Bourne Deepings effective short corner routine. Clear-headed thought in our own circle was called for, but the general panic was in effect there as well, and an early set-piece was given away when an attempted pass out through a crowd smacked into the feet of one of our own players. The initial routine actually went wrong, and the ball was briefly on one of our sticks, but again the clearance was too ambitious and got intercepted, with the ball switched back to the top of the circle and struck smoothly into the corner.
The rest of the half progressed in a similar manner, our attacks breaking down due to bad decision making, Bourne Deeping looking more coherent and forcing shorts. They nearly made it two when the ball was on a forwards stick two yards out with an open goal, only for Jans desperate slide to deflect clear. It was a temporary reprieve as another short was switched left, and the shot was goal bound until it struck Neils thigh. Penalty-flick, which Bourne Deepings captain efficiently converted. Time for the half had expired during the preceding short, so we turned around extra deflated.
The second half was better (it couldnt have been much worse!), as at least we took the game to our visitors more and forced some shorts. However, in keeping with everything else going on, our short routine was malfunctioning rather horribly; Im not sure we got a single shot off. We did have one big chance, fairly early on in the second period when an attack down the left saw the keeper drawn and the ball pulled across the face of goal to Rupert. Unfortunately, he lost his footing on the slippery Catz astro at the crucial moment, and, although he got his shot at the unguarded net on target, it lacked pace and was comfortably cleared. Which summed the match up, rather. I dont remember another clear cut chance being created after this...
The last ten minute saw Bourne Deeping giving us a masterclass in retaining possession, moving off the ball to allow them to play in triangles and being willing to pass square and backwards as well as forwards. They were in control, as they had been for the majority of the game. There was absolutely nothing undeserved in the final scoreline, the better team on the day had won.
A number of records that we had been proud off disappeared with defeat; our unbeaten home record, having scored in every game and most obviously the leadership of the Division. We have slipped to third as both Boston and Louth won their matches. We must put this game behind us rapidly and get back to winning ways next week when we visit a Wisbech 4ths team who are in good form, having won their last four matches. It wont be easy...","Men's 3rds lose to Bourne Deeping 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Wisbechs position at the lower end of the 5NW table might have suggested they were good opponents to face in the circumstances, but their recent form (four straight wins, one of which was against league leaders Louth) told a different tale. From this match, I think recent form is more indicative of their standard; they looked far too good to go down.
The first half was end-to-end stuff, neither team dominating territory, possession nor short-corner count. We did create the clearer chances, though. The first goal came from good recycling of the ball. Neil cut out an attempted clearance and squared for Paul, who advanced towards the 25 and played it into the circle. A clever reverse stick deflection (?miss-control?) from Matt  got the ball through to Rob, who swept into the bottom corner.
Our second came from a short (rarity!), but not a smooth routine (oh). The set-piece had come from an attempted clearance that rose up and smacked Rob on the arm. Feeling bruised, Rob wasnt up to taking a clean shot and as he is normally the man in prime position, this lead to a reshuffling of positions. Rupert, now in the distributor role, actually tried to find Rob out on the wide right, but the ball was a little off target, making Rob chase. This may have drawn the defence out of position (flubbed routines have a habit of doing this), so when Rob reached the loose ball and fired across, Matt was unmarked on the penalty spot. He controlled, and flicked home.
Our lead was preserved by a key clearance from Paul off a Wisbech short. A much cleaner routine than the one we scored with saw a firm shot beat Lino, only for Paul, on station on the post, to sweep the ball away off the line. Close. Then, in the dying embers of the first half, Wisbech gifted us a three-goal lead. A hopeful ball from well inside our half had taken a deflection off a Wisbech stick and was trundling harmlessly into their circle. Most of the players remained the other side of the halfway line, so the home keeper took the decision to prevent a long corner by trapping the ball. Ali chased up to apply what he surely believed was token pressure, only for the keepers attempted kick pass to pick him our perfectly. A couple of paces to reach the circle and Ali was able to roll the ball into the open goal. To make matters worse for the home stopper, time in the half expired just as his team were getting the ball back to centre. If he had let it out for a long, we probably wouldnt have even got to take it!
After that particular blow to the ribs, it wasnt really surprising that the home side came out in the second half slower than they had for the first. We were having more of the game, breaking up play in midfield to feed our wingers and generally looking fairly comfortable. Indeed, Matt thought he had added our fourth when turning a lifted ball into the goal, only for it to be chalked off on grounds of danger.
Wisbech threw more bodies forward as the half progressed, in particular no.19 (the best player on the pitch by a distance) pushing up from his defensive position. With 13 minutes left, he set up a goal as he used his pace to go around the outside of our defence and then pull the ball back for a teammate to sweep in. Wisbech also forced a number of shorts as the second half progressed, and when one of these squirmed under Lino and then sprang up and hit Paul on the line, we had conceded our customary penalty-flick. Conferring with the Umpire told us there were 94 seconds left to hang onto our win. Except... The flick hit the bar, landed a couple of inches in front of the goalline and stayed out.
After the miss, the flick-taker collected the loose ball and slowly dribbled it back to centre, to everyones bemusement. Whether he honestly believed the ball had rebounded off something inside the goal or was trying to pull the wool over the Umpires eyes is one for him to answer, either way they stood firm in their decision. With so little time left and a two goal cushion, it was game over. Three valuable points secured.
Elsewhere, Bourne Deeping 4ths showed there was nothing personal in their continual undermining of our promotion challenge by also taking out one of our rivals, Boston, 2-1. Combined with our victory, we have moved back into 2nd place with Louth the only team ahead of us, by a margin of two points. They come a-visiting next week for a top of the table clash, our last match this season against a promotion rival.

The opening twenty minutes were pretty even, with both teams creating chances. Rob had a couple of shots for us, and Ali looked like he was in only to be called back by the whistle, whilst Lino had some saves to make between our posts. But the match changed when the first goal went the visitors way. Pretty ropey from a defensive standpoint as we managed to both miss a tackle and leave a man unmarked, which eventually culminated in a tap-in.
Our play became increasingly narrow as we sought an equaliser/got a bit panicked about being behind. But there were no further really clear cut openings for either side in the rest of the first half, meaning the teams turned around with the score 0-1.
The next goal was obviously crucial, and when it came for Louth in the opening sixty seconds of the second period, we were in serious trouble. It was annoyingly preventable as well, as the ball was on one of our sticks for a while and wasnt cleared; instead possession was lost and the ball pushed past the advancing Lino.
We tried to find a way back into the game, but that meant throwing bodies forwards which Louth were exploiting well by keeping their forwards high and picking them out with cleanly struck passes. We were stretched, whilst they were compact as their midfield held deep as they was no need for them to chase goals. Despite the danger this appeared to create, it was actually a short corner that provided Louths third goal, when a cleanly struck shot found the corner despite one of our sticks getting a bit of it.
With ten minutes left, the result was now decided and it was just the margin that was to be confirmed. Louth were still the most likely, and it took a diving goalline clearance from Neil to keep it at three. He couldnt repeat the trick two minutes from time when he found himself isolated on the goalline and facing Louths best stick player, who the ball had broken to after another save from Lino. The fizzing undercut was only ever ending in one place.
The most disappointing aspect of the match was the lack of energy the team displayed, and in such a big game. We were second to most loose balls and the tracking and marking was pretty awful. We have fallen to third as a consequence, as Boston won to go past us. Also, importantly, for the first time this season finishing in the top two is out of our hands, we will need other results to go our way. With four matches left, Louth lead the way by 4 points, Boston are 2nd, we are third and St. Ives are only a point further back in fourth. The main ray of hope is that both Boston and St. Ives have a match with Louth left on their schedules. So now it is a case of win our games (starting next Saturday at Ely) and crossing fingers.","Men's 3rds lose to Louth 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

We went into the match with our 2nd highest goalscorer absent from central midfield. South pre reported he had been unable to shift the slugabed, either for our game or for the 4ths friendly in the morning, which Tom had been meant to Umpire. This promptly got him the Lemon vote from both the 3rds and 4ths. Winning multiple awards by refusing to leave your pit!

Those that had made the short journey for the 3pm(!) push-back started the game on top, working the Ely keeper and seeing chances go narrowly off-target. However, we didnt manage to convert our quick start into a lead, and having weathered that the hosts settled into their game, generating a pretty even contest.
The first half was nearly up before a breakthrough was made, and importantly it came for us. Rob collected a loose ball towards the left edge of the circle, worked himself around onto his front-stick (!), and squeezed a shot through a narrow gap between the keeper and his near post. Limited time remained in the half, but there was enough for Johnny B, back between the sticks this week, to be called on to make a sharp save. The identity of the player trying to put the ball past him was a bit of a surprise, one of his own defenders. The anonymous culprit (anonymous as he presumably didnt mean to do this) deflected a hard-hit Ely cross goalwards, but JBs reflexes were quick enough to put the ball out for a long corner. We turned around a goal ahead, which felt about right on the balance of play.
Best period of play came in the opening fifteen minutes of the second half. We kept Ely pressed back and were regularly creating chances, just like the opening exchange of the match. Those chances became goals when the rolling substitution plan returned Joe to the fray, but as a forward rather than a midfielder. The impact was immediate, Joe and Stu exchanging passes down the left to get Stu to the byline. The ball was worked from there via Joe to Rob at the top of the circle. Rob dragged left to shift the keeper and put the ball home.
Soon after, Rob thought he had his hattrick when the ball sprang up off the keeper and he smacked the hanging orb into the goal. Only problem was it was at least 6 feet up, maybe nearer 7 when he connected. Robs attempt to prove he had taken his shot from shoulder height was met with general derision, and when that demonstration was allied with a hangdog But that was my dream goal! we had a co-Lemon alongside Rip Van Winkle. The main thing to take from this was that if one ever finds oneself on the opposite side of a Badminton net from Rob, beware the forehand smash.
The third was soon in coming however, and like our second it was well-worked. Ali jabbed the ball away from his opponent on halfway, drew the full-back towards him and fed Rob, who had spun right into the channel. The Ely sweeper was forced to cover, so when Robs cross cut out the Centre-Back and found Joe, he just had the keeper to beat. As the stopper came out to meet him, Joe showed admirable vision in slipping the ball right, leaving Andy, racing up in support, with a simple finish into an open goal. However, simple wasnt Andys thing. Instead he carried the ball to a yard out and then flicked it up into the goal, managing to make it stick behind a stanchion halfway up. Fancy embellishments r us. Soon after, Joe thought he had added a fourth when he fizzed an undercut from the top of the circle high into the net, but it was (correctly) ruled out for a foot in the build-up. Sweet finish, mind, and the decision was accepted without any histrionics.
Ely pulled a goal back midway through the second-half with a neat flicked finish from a short corner. At roughly the same time, Matt had hobbled off due to a smack on the knee, which unfortunately necessitated moving Joe away from the front-line, where he had been causing Ely all sorts of trouble, to fill the gap in central mid. Though everyone was in accustomed positions we lost impetus with this re-jig and with Ely taking encouragement from registering, the home side had more of the play in the remaining time. Despite a number of shorts forced, they didnt add to their tally, giving a final score of 3-1.

Sunday morning brought the news of a significant result elsewhere in 5NW as Boston won 2-0 at leaders Louth, thus eliminating the cushion Louth had established by beating us a week ago. As a result the top of the table has concertinaed-up, with none of the sides having margin for error in the remaining games.

One final thing. South 3rds 12-13 now have the best record any South team has ever complied in Division 5NW. And that includes the 2nds, who spent the best part of a decade trying, before they sneaked up to 4NW via the backdoor after finishing 4th (events higher up the hockey pyramid lefts gaps, which it is not inconceivable might also occur this season). Seeing as the 2nds never actually finished in a promotion spot in this Division, they should damn well come back and do it properly, Yuh-Huh!

We were further reassured he was on top form when he was the last person arrive.
However, with peoples minds more on the Annual Dinner (aka apocalash) to come, the jovial 3s decided to get the hockey bit out of the way to move onto more serious matters of pennying drinks1, arguing over which college is the best^ and challenging the 4s to a boat race2. Having beaten St Ives 3s 2-1 a few weeks ago, and assuming that their 4s were worse than their 3s - we waltzed onto the pitch with a (semi) new formation of 4-4-2 - Lacking Jan and JB in defence due to poor excuses (ski(v)ing) Tom P stepped up from the 4s whilst Joe W joined Barton up front to try and bundle some goals into the back of the net.
The first 10-15 minutes were pretty good for South - having a few chances and a few short corners we were pretty positive about getting the first goal.which we eventually did!! Huza! So why is the score 0-1 at half time you ask? Not to be out-done by Mr Anonymous the other week trying to deflect the ball into our own goal - in a text book deflection off a  foot the ball lodged itself into our own top left corner leaving Steve flailing and speechless! If there was an award for the best own goal it would have most certainly been up there! There were a few chances from the long corners too, with Ali taking and then working its way into the D. T South missed by a couple of inches on a couple of occasions, Joe got a couple stopped, Rupert almost got one and Barton tried to work his reverse stick magic - alas to no avail!
Half time - Ali gave some kind of motivational speech. Neil didnt fancy our chances so made up an excuse and left*. Tom S moved into left-back in Neils absence - a position which he seemed to enjoy thoroughly3.
After this, Rupert and Joe swapped positions with Rupert joining Barton up front and Joe taking left wing. There were a few 1-2s between Joe and Tom S on the left but nothing fruitful came of these chances. 7 penalty corners later (no joking!)..Paul decided enough was enough! (akin to Linos well if youre not going to tackle them then Im going to do it for you! Mom statement the other week.) Running up field, Paul (sweeper) found himself in uncharted territory.the other half of the pitch!! (He had heard rumours that the grass was greener over here - only to find it was also made of AstroTurf..?!) However, undeterred from this discovery - like a duck to water Paul soon found the ball, winding back his stick he released a rocket4 into the D which Barton managed to get a deflection on leading to a 1-1 scoreline. 
Utilising this momentum, 10 minutes from the end Rupert almost put us in front with a (an almost signature move now) dive and flick which went just over the top left bar. To quote Barton: the best goal that never was! Unlucky.
The last few minutes got a little frantic after this, Matt and Oli decided to do a bit of running and passing multi-tasking showing real danger in the dying few minutes.
Full time stayed at 1-1 - no-one went to teas because we were all frantically trying to get ready for the dinner in time. Sorry St Ives - we promise it was nothing personal.

CSouth tried manfully thoughout but were undone by a fit and skillful opposition who bossed the midfield and always had the edge.
St Neots quickly went two goals up. The home team had chances, with some neat attacking moves from all angles, usually via Ed Bligh, Nick Greaves, Rupert Espley and Andrew Fraser, but were unable to find the killer ball. John Greaves went close from a Nick Greaves cross, but a slight deflection by the excellent St Neots keeper was sufficient. CSouth did get a goal back as Andrew Fraser, after one of many good runs, shot towards goal, for the lurking James Raikes to get a touch from close range - probably the only way the keeper could be beaten.
After Half time CSouth stuck to their game, and had good possession, and movement. Unfortunately the ball was given away too easily, leaving players upfield, and St Neots capitalised with two more goals past a battling but overrun defence, with men-mountain EvansSiddorns manning the ramparts much better than the scoreline suggests.
It was pleasing to see the team trying to play as a team, helping one another, being available to receive the ball, finding space, and movement. On this occasion, against superior opposition, it wasn't quite enough.

South 4s turned up nice and early at Ely to find themselves blinded by the low sun sinking over the Fens and Ely's away kit prompting the question 'What part of our home kit clashes with this clubs colours again?"". However, it was South who ended up making the early running and took the lead within minutes of the start of the game. Phil Harvey collected the ball and fired it wide to Boris who cut to the baseline and pulled the perfect ball across the D for Nathan M to tap in for his first league goal of the season. 1-0 South.
It was to be the start of something good and promising as South relentlessly poured forward and applied concerted pressure on Ely. Several good chances came and went without a second goal being registered, before Ely struck a fortuitous goal against the run of play. A ball was worked around the top of the D by the Ely midfield before a shot found its way through the South defence via Shahzads kickers.
South had plenty of subs and made good use of them to keep things fresh, but remaining solid and organised despite the rolling changes. One such change nearly paid off as the skipper bought himself on and promptly started to pull the Ely defence left and right and finding spaces to receive the ball and set up several attacks that unfortunately largely petered out or flashed dangerously wide. The best chance saw a through-ball played up to the captain with his back to goal. Flicking the ball around the last defender and bearing down on goal, the initial shot was blocked. Trying to keep out of the way of the on-rushing keeper and the inevitable clearing kick, the skipper slipped and landed just where the clearance was placed and received a blow to the chin that would have left lesser men reeling.
So, 1-1 at the break and South full of confidence that the game was there for the taking. However, something had obviously been said in the Ely team talk as they continued to weather the South attacks and then in a 10 minute blitz managed to strike twice. The Fenlanders had been blooding several youngsters and suddenly they clicked, overloaded us on the right hand side and managed to work an opening to take the lead, before repeating the trick minutes later. The second was something of a comedy of errors as the daisy-cutter shot evaded Shahzad, and several defenders on the line who somehow failed to get rid. Even Ely were slightly shocked as some wag called 'Make sure it hits the backboard next time.'
It nearly got worse as a third attack followed a similar pattern and when the shot caught a defender's foot a flick was awarded. The skipper called a quick conflab to sort out the side while Shahzad stared down the Ely attacker taking the flick who sent the flick high, wide and not so handsomely into the fence to the left of the South post. Battle was rejoined and South proceeded to apply near relentless pressure on the Ely goal trying to find a way back into the game. Several chances came and went but shots going wide (John/Wilco), deflected onto the post and side netting (Simon) and shorts breaking down left South fearing the worse.
South thought they had clawed a goald back when following a long corner, John G fired a peach of a ball across the D for the captain to get the deftest of flicks past the Ely keeper. With a blood curdling roar, the South skipper wheeled away in celebration only to find the neither umpire had seen it and the Ely defence suggesting an over exbuerant celebration to be ungentlemanly and suspect. 3-1 it stayed and despite several more attacks, South failed to find another way through and that's how it remained to the final whistle.
All in all, a good tight game that slipped away from us in the 10 minute spell where Ely put two (nearly three) past us without reply. It was good to see a large squad turn out again for a match for the 4s and with some luck and some perserverance, the first points cant be far away. St Ives next weekend would be a good start.

The early signs were good as a plethora of players once again allowed us the luxury of substitutes and we started brightly. 
Some good work in and around the centre of the park by the dynamic duo of Phil H and Joe W worked the ball around well and made good use of Jacob and Nathan on the wings to provide balls across the D for the forward line and put some pressure on the Saints defence.
It wasn't hugely surprising then that South took the early lead following a well worked short corner routine. The ball was sent out quickly and accurately to Joe, who expertly trapped the ball to allow the Monckasaurus's Mallet (TM) to unleash an unstoppable rocket into the bottom right hand corner. South retained the upper hand and kept pushing forward looking for the second, only to find the Saints keeper on top form and more than a match for all we could throw at him.
St Ives seemed to have a lot of new young players compared to last seasons fixtures and it showed. After a nervy start, they soon got into their own rhythm and started to roll us back by applying concerted pressure in the midfield, then using their pace to work the ball around and behind us. One such spell bought them a succession of short corners as the South defence found it hard to clear their lines before the inevitable happened and the equaliser came.
Determined not to buckle, South roared back and carved out several opportunities of thier own. Shots flew left and right of the Saints posts and a set of sort corners came to nothing; South's clearest opportunity before half time came when a quick turn over in midfield released Simon who dragged a shot wide to the right when it seemed easier to find the target. At the other end despite manful resistance, the South defence was breached twice more as Saints pacy wing players were able to work balls across the South D with more accuracy, enabling shots to be rained down on Shahzad from all angles. Most were repelled, but some stuck and the half closed with South 3-1 down.
The next goal was going to be crucial and the hope was it would come for South, but alas it was not to be. Despite continually working hard to make the openings and breaks that were required (and several good chances came and went including a succession of short corners that we couldnt capitalise on) it never came. Saints added only one more to their tally though and this was down to the tireless efforts of the South defence who were resolute in mopping up the attacks as they came through reducing Saints to some hit and hope tactics where shots fizzed in from outside the D, but without finding the vital contact required to beat Shahzad.
All in all, it was another good performance that bodes well for the club as a whole. Debutant Rasmus Petersen put in a solid and capable display in his first competitive hockey match (ever, not just for South!) and with the new squad additions that have been unearthed in Joe, Charlie and Nathan H its providing ample competition for places which is only a benefit for the squad and club as a whole. A little more calm and composure and a bit of luck as well and we'll be going places. 6NWS is always a competitive league and with a lot of new faces this year, its just taking us time to find our feet.","Men's 4ths lose to St Ives 5","False","False",0,1,"True","True",0
1445,"27/10/2012","League",4,45,"16:00",24,"Away","1","5","1","2","False","False","False","M4s fielded an experimental line up this weekend with Ian and Simon drafted in to shore up a defence bereft of several regulars as a bare 11 was sent north to Peterborough to take on the young whippersnappers of COP 8s who have been leading the pack chasing City's M5s in Div 6NWS this season. Any nerves felt were soon settled as the first few attacks from COPs were swiftly dealt with and turned into counter-attacks of our own. One such occasion saw Simon intercept a wayward pass from the COPs winger and promptly fired the ball out to Jacob on the right. The ball was then worked around the COP backline and back across the pitch towards the left for Boris to fire home the opening goal.
It looked increasingly likely that it would be South that added to the scoresheet first as the defence manned the barricades to thwart attack after attack and tee up the midfield to carve out chances galore for the front pair. However, while trying to clear their lines right on the goaline, a flick was awarded to COP and gratefully dispatched. Still coming to terms with that set back, the backline gave away a sloppy ball under pressure and in trying to recover were twisted inside out by the COP forward line before a shot squirted through Shahzads kickers to give COP the lead, somewhat against the run of play.
South cleared their heads however and carved out several more opportunities to restore parity. None were taken and half time came with South back on top although trailing 1-2. More of the same was the demand from the skipper and that was what we got as the second half got underway. Ian pushed slightly further forward to help shield the defence and suport the midfield as they tried to cope with the pace of the young lads pouring forward, but what eluded David B and Rasmus down the flanks as they calmly mopped up attacks left and right, Simon was collecting and sweeping away with authority through the centre.
More chances were created and spurned by South as a series of short corners were repelled or came to nought and the game began to stretch as a result. In the end they were to prove costly as the wily fox playing in midfield for COP began to take control and started launching attacks for the younger squadmates to chase into the corners and put pressure on the tiring South defence. The third goal came from a cheap short corner conceded by tired feet. Taking advantage of loading the D to their numerical advantage, the injector played quick short balls out that were then pinged around to draw the South defenders out and work the angles to create space for the shot that was duly dispatched.
From that point, South's prolifigacy took on Liverpudlian proportions as chance after chance went begging while COPs became more and more clinical and started forcing several more short corners and attacks. 
South's resistance remained strong until the last minutes of the game when once more, COPs forward line overloaded the tiring defence and took two more goals; one from open play flashed across Shahzad and high into the net, before the final game came again from a well worked short corner that dragged the South defence around to work the space for the shot to be taken. South never gave up though and right up to the dying seconds of the game were still getting shots away but just not on target or enough to test the COP keeper.
All in all and despite the scoreline, another decent performance in adversity with leaders appearing all over the pitch to keep the team organised and motivated. Boris was excellent in this regard keeping the team organised from the front and the midfield were finding and creating space to provide support despite having to attempt to keep the COP No 15 quiet as well. The defence were so well organised that you'd hardly have known that you had two players out of position as many attacks were snuffed out quickly by David B and Rasmus (who was second in the MoM votes for another solid display at right back) and Ian and Simon were combining well in the centre to break up attacks. Having said that though, the skipper for one will be glad to welcome the regulars back next week so he can retreat to the opposite end of the pitch where he belongs!","Men's 4ths lose to City of Peterborough 8","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

St Neots 3s always produce a close and friendly game and so it proved again as South were unlucky not to come away with something from this game as they had the lions share of possession and chances, but just weren't able to make them count.
Dave and Charlie were keeping everyone organised at the back, while Ky, David and Rasmus were keeping the Saints wide players quiet throughout most of the game. When attacks came through, Shahzad was able to repel the majority of the chances that snuck past the back line. In fact, it was a sure sign of how well drilled the back line was that South did not concede a single short corner throughout the entire game. Both goals when they came, were a result of South getting over confident in their possession and committing too many people forward, allowing Saints to break and overload the defence to effectively pass the ball around us and isolate Shahzad.
The midfield were also combining well - for large periods of the game we kept Saints quiet, especially their most dangerous player, and possession was built well from the back and a lot of good opportunities were created to get us into the final 25. Nathan, Nathan, Tom and Wilco made good combinations down either flank, with Joe and Ian working hard in the middle to break up Saints play and support the attacks.
The forwards were also combining well and creating a lot of space for the supporting midfield players to get forward. Attacking short corners were organised and remained so despite the rapid interchange of players between Simon, Boris, John and James, but unfortunately the few shots we were able to get away were being fended away or narrowly off target. How John's goal-bound shot off one short in particular didnt go in, I don't think any of us will ever know.
Easily the best performance from the M4s this season, showing that the team is starting to really work well together despite the larger than usual squad numbers at our disposal. A little more time playing together and we could be unstoppable. Next up is Bourne Deeping 5s; a team that South doubled last year including a game where South overturned a 3-1 deficit to run out 4-3 winners. More of the same would be a nice early birthday present for the skipper.","Men's 4ths lose to St Neots 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

It all looked good at the start as per usual with CSouth taking the lead. James Raikes pounced onto the ball at the top of the D, with defenders in a flap all around him, to slot it carefully into goal. This woke up the home team who dominated the rest of the first half, scoring 3 goals with a variety of approaches, mainly arising from rapid passing moves and players in space taking their opportunities.
CSouth were not out of it, with midfield dynamo Whittaker-Marchman pivotal to our best plays, and the Monckosaurous firing his trademark thunderbolts upfield, but the perennial problem in the final third of the pitch meant that few clearcut chances arose. 
After the interval things continued  in similar vein; Deeping snatched a fourth goal, and by now their confidence was high. The time had come for action, and the man to step up was Boris Lossy. He epitomised the ""We're losing but what the hell....they only have eleven players too"" up and at 'em attitude of the late lamented Corporal Jones/Clive Dunn. A pinpoint John Greaves cross from the right found Boris on the P-spot to smash the ball into goal. Shortly after this another route one Monck blaster found hopalong Crowther lurking upfield; Charles C laid the ball off to Boris L who coolly rounded the keeper for his second. Could this be a comeback ???
Deeping's fifth goal 7 mins from the end made this look unlikely, but an accurate Monck free hit from within the opposition half to Greaves arrived at the same time as the keeper, but Greaves' annoying hassling discombobulated him enough to push the ball into his own net. 
This gave renewed hope, and hero of the moment Charles Crowther was able to capitalise on another Greaves cross to net the final equalising goal from close range.

Good question, but unfortunately not one that involved an answer that would avoid a cold, drizzly evening's game in late November. Still, the 4s were feeling chipper and after watching Nathan H warm himself up enthusiastically in the goalies pads for the first time and yet another full squad to choose from, the odds on continuing the current run of form (unbeaten in 2) looked good.
Or so we thought. Barely a minute had elapsed before COP Vets showed their collective experience to leave South woefully exposed. Some confusion over a free hit saw possession conceded cheaply to the opposition and while everyone tried to work out what was going on, the COP forward was bearing down on poor Nathan who had been bellowing for someone to wake up and watch the free man. Indeed, everyone watched said free man coolly slot the ball past Nathan to open the scoring.
It was the wake up call we required despite the wet weather. Minds focused, South set about trying to win their battles in all areas of the park. To a man, everyone put in a shift to ensure that the opposition weren't able to get a stranglehold on the game. Ian, Joe and Phil were tenacious in midfield, Nathan M, Tom R, Wilco and Jason applied pressure on the flanks and tracked back whenever we were defending and provided the width to get attacks going when we turned the ball over. John, Boris and Simon were chasing balls around the 25 as Peterborough attempted to find a way through by switching play across the flanks and causing a few hairy moments for the opposition as Simon was a hair's breadth from intercepting one ball across the D. The defence were solid after the early abberation with Ky, David and debutant Tom working hard in the full back positions, with John and Dave mopping up through the middle. Nathan H in goal generally had very little to do, but was more than up to the task when called upon to make a save or two.
As a result of the great effort put in by the team, Peterborough never really got into a settled rhythm and the pressure told. Several times the play broke down with South winning free hits that Dave used as an opportunity to pepper the Peterborough D with shots that when they weren't deflected wide or mopped up by the opposition, were going just wide of target from the strikers. However, the pressure was starting to tell as the chances were coming thick and fast.
Halfway through the first half, parity was restored. The midfield retrieved the ball and the ball was sent out to the right where Wilco and John G had been finding a lot of space. A series of passes were interchanged between them before John played a ball back from the baseline to Joe who had come steaming towards the top of the D. His snapshot was partially deflected away from a defender but straight to the captain who made no mistake and slammed the ball into the bottom left corner. 1-1
A South breakaway saw Nathan M and Simon peeling away to take on the Peterborough defence. As the captain tried to drag the last man away to give Nathan room to carry the ball into the D for a shot on goal, the defender wasn't fooled and snuffed out the chance as Nathan shaped to shoot. The chance was gone and the rest of the half passed without further incident as neither side was able to carve out any clear opportunities.
Half time came and went and despite Dave attempting to exchange some witty banter with certain members of the opposition and umpires through the second half, there wasn't really many more clear opportunities for either team. Several snapshots from South players whistled the wrong side of the post and a couple of short corner opportunities went begging, but the real excitement was saved for the final few moments of the half.
The resolute defence was put under strain in the final 5 minutes as a series of short corners were conceded. Stout defending ensured that Peterborough struggled to get a shot away from consecutive corners as they desperately looked for the winner that would maintain their push at the top of the league. Bellowing like a demented cow, the captain snuggly wrapped in coat and gesticulating wildly tried to ""help"" organise the defence for one last effort as a final short was awarded as the final whistle sounded. ""NO SHOT SOUTH! EVERYONE RUN LIKE HELL AND GET THAT BALL TO SAFETY! DONT CON..."". Whether I helped the South defence gird their loins sufficiently for the final corner, or I simply irritated and distracted the Peterborough attack, the injector managed to scuff the ball into the D, allowing John S to collect and shepherd the ball to safety and increase that unbeaten streak to 3 games for the 4s.
A draw has never felt so good! Considering the awful start, the team stood firm and didn't allow their heads to drop. Everyone gave their all for the cause and produced a magnificent game to hold the team currently
3 in the league to a draw. Now, we just need to keep this going and extend that run and start to climb the table. Tom P had an excellent game at the back and Nathan H deservedly swept the nominations for man of the match firstly for his willingness to pad up and then for the great, authoritive game between the sticks. As was pointed out, he's probably now painted himself into a corner and made it harder to avoid taking another turn while Shahzad recuperates!","Men's 4ths earn a point against City of Peterborough Vets","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

A sizeable squad early in the preceding week was slowly whittled down to a bare 11 on matchday, with some notable absences from both the rear and front line leaving the daunting of taking on a team that tucked 5 past us in the first game of the season.
With a low sun setting behind one goal, things were looking up from the off as South won the toss, kept the sun on their backs and immediately set about imposing themselves on the opposition right from their pushback. Ian and Phil took the game to the opposition, pressing in tandem so that one was always available to pick up the opposition should they break past the other. Wilco and Joe were running the wings and providing much needed width for the back line, especially on defensive 16s as we were well aware that we needed to provide support to David and Howard in the full back positions while Ky was taking Dave's place of taking the set pieces.
In fact, the back line were superbly well organised. Tom P moved from full back to centre this week to cover for the loss of the Monckasaurus and he was everywhere. If he wasnt charging across to support the full backs, he was dropping deep to snuff out attacks that breached the defence or setting off on a run through the gaps that appeared quite often in the centre of the pitch as the St Neots forwards and midfield over committed in their search for the opening goal.
It wasn't long in coming; a good spell of pressure from the South midfield produced a series of free hits from the panicked Saints defence saw first Simon then Nathan taking snapshots that worked the Saints goalkeeper and produced a couple of fine saves.  The movement from the front pair only added to the confusion in the Saints back line as more and more gaps were opening up for the South midfield to exploit and force more turn overs and free hits. One such hit was taken quickly by Ian, who drilled a fierce drive into the heart of the D from just outside the 25. It was begging for a touch and Simon duly obliged, deflecting it through the goalie's legs to set South on their way.
Knowing that being first to score was usually not the most helpful thing for them, South kept their foot on the gas, piling forward at every opportunity looking for the second goal to give them the cushion, they've never really had in any previous league game. Several short corners were won and despite not taking them, the goalie was kept honest in the majority of them. The South defence were immense in keeping the Saints at bay and when they did get some shots away, Tom R was more than capable of dealing with them.
So 1-0 at half time, South on the offensive and the skipper called for more of the same. It was going to be vital for both teams to get the next goal, South to hopefully kill the game off, Saints to get themselves back into it. Once again, South were up and at 'em right from the off. The midfield were able to pick their passes to get balls wide to the wings and forwards who were pouring forward at every opportunity. 
It wasn't entirely one way traffic, as Saints looked to get the ball upfield quickly whenever they had the chance to, but the ball was certainly pinging from 25 to 25 at break-neck speed.
South had several good opportunities to extend their lead, but the Saints had two outstanding players in their goalkeeper and a young lad playing at the back who were quick and alert to most thigns that came through; Nathan had a couple of chances that were sheperded away by said defender and another where he narrowly failed to beat the keeper to a loose ball. However, it was clear that it was starting to be a question of when rather than if South could add to thier lead. When it came, it was a thing of beauty. Phil worked tirelessly in midfield to take several players out of the game and tee up Ian who made a lung bursting run from deep to collect the ball on the 25 yard line, skip past the challenge of a defender and unleash a thunderbolt from the edge of the D that flew across the keeper and into the far corner of the goal to make it 2-0 to South.
To give Saints credit, they never let their heads drop and they continued to play some very good, intelligent hockey. They had a near unrelenting spell shortly after the second goal where Tom P and Ian found themselves in the right place at the right time to make timely interceptions and then recycle the ball to set up counter-attacks for South. One such breakdown saw the ball come out to the left to David B who cracked a peach of a shot upfield to Simon who flicked the ball around the defence to attempt to set Nathan away, but instead adding even more pace to the ball and the chance went begging. Not to be deterred, David then attempted the same thing across the pitch to set Joe free on the right after advancing to almost the half way line. The disgust heard in the bellowed cry of ""chase it then!"" as Joe failed to make appropriate use of the opportunity and the ball went out for a deep side line ball.
There was still time for some slapstick action before the final whistle as Simon gallantly took away Boris's LoM award (the 4s VC informed his captain 45 mins before pushback he was not coming) by getting a foot in the way of Phil's goalbound strike. He then attempted to make amends by snapping up a mishit 16 from the Saints defence and attempted to play Nathan in,  in the D but only succeeded in playing the ball back to the Saint's defender.
As Saints pushed harder to get back into the game, South were content to soak up the pressure and attempt to hit Saints on the break as the game drew to a close. Simon had a half chance when attempting to redirect a shot from Phil goalwards, but failed to get a decent connection. With the final seconds ticking away, South found themselves in a position for one final attack. The ball was worked out wide to Joe on the right wing, who played a neat 1-2 with Howard supporting from right back. The ball was fed into Nathan on the baseline who took out not one, but two defenders who were attempting to show him and the ball off the pitch. A neat cut back found Simon unmarked, who could only manage to crack a snapshot against the post and wide with what proved to be the final action of the game.
So, the 4s recorded the first win of the season and a first league clean sheet to boot. Tom R had a great game after volunteering to don the damp goalie's kit and the back four of Howard, Ky, Tom P and David had a very solid game at the back. Joe, Wilco, Ian and Phil were dominant in midfield as always and Simon and Nathan were causing no end of trouble for the Saints backline throughout the game ensuring that the home defence were constantly looking over their shoulders.

The other, er, goal for us was to be the first team in the league to score against them.
We were able to hold on for the first seven minutes of the game, after which we conceded the first of the goals. South needed to take their chances to score our solitary one goal, but these were few and far between. Down the other end it wasn't all one-sided, with the defence working overtime and Joe making a few good saves.
The second half was in fact more open, but again it was City who made the best of their opportunities. Other notable occurrences such as some cricket-style defending from Ian and a brilliantly timed two-footed tackle from John Greaves raised the spirits of the onlookers, while a few breaks from the South bunch got as far as the City D, but were always snuffed out in the final moments. Unfortunately/fortunately, it's unlikely that we will be seeing the City 5s in our league next year to get that goal.

Once everyone was in and sorted out, the team was raring to go and get stuck into some hockey for the first time this year. Peterborough have a young and skillful team but the captain's message was simple: get stuck in, use the extra subs we lacked for the reverse fixture and let's get some goals and give them a real game.
It turned out that the youngsters were also somewhat ring-rusty as the opening stages were played as a very cat and mouse affair. Neither midfield fully took the game by the scruff of the neck as the ball pinged around from player to player. As predicted, the Peterborough team were having a tendancy to steam down the South left and as the game settled down, Peterborough used one such attack to squeeze a shot in to open the scoring.
Stung by the strike, South started to exert some influence of their own in the midfield and several good breaks were worked down both flanks. 
Some willing running from Nathan and Andy, combining well with some good distribution from Wilco, Dave M and Ian meant South were starting to work their way around and behind Peterborough but finding that the lack of games since December meant the final ball was sometimes a little lacking and the breakthrough wasn't quite coming, although the feeling was that the pressure was beginning to tell.
A well worked ball forward found Nathan in some space to take on the winger, skin him for pace and flick the ball inside to Boris. With one touch, Boris turned inside and fed the ball towards Simon F lurking near the top of the D. One of Peterborough's older heads at the back saw the danger but miscued the clearance skewing it sideways. Quick as a flash, the skipper pounced; gathering the loose ball and sprinting for the D as the covering left back tried to desperately make up the ground. It wasn't even close as Simon entered the D, drew the keeper forward and cooly dispatched the ball past his out stretched kicker and into the bottom corner. 1-1
Buoyed by the equaliser, South started to boss the game for a period and soon had Peterborough caught cold again with another quickly played ball from front to back. Once again, Nathan used his pace down the left  to terrorise the Peterborough rightback before pulling the ball back for Simon F. Nutmegging the last man, he burst through into the D again but as he went to pull the trigger (and with Boris screaming for a pass at the top of the D), the skipper found the only dodgy patch of ground in that end of the Catz pitch and promptly did an impression of a newborn foal, much to the relief (and no doubt hilarity) of the Peterborough defence. 1-1 it remained at half time despite one further chance from a short corner that was cleared from the danger area following a smart shot from John G towards the right hand post.
More of the same was required but unfortunately letting the oppo score first again, wasn't what the skipper had in mind during his half time team talk. Peterborough started to find more and more space on South's left and started to get several opportunities as they started to overload us on that side. Shahzad had to make several smart saves to push the ball away from danger before resistance finally crumbled and Peterborough got their second goal of the game.
Peterborough's confidence was growing and they started to pour forward looking for more opportunities and goals down that left hand side. David B and Ky were finding themselves busier and busier as the game went on, but the cooler, more experienced heads prevailed as time and again they swept up the attacks as they came through or forced the youngsters into over committing and making mistakes.
South were never out of it though and more space was opening up behind Peterborough as they started to push further and further forward. One such break saw Rasmus maurauding forward from the right back position and beating all comers with the ball. Turning the ball inside to Wilco, the ball was switched across to Nathan on the left wing. Having the beating of his man virtually every time he went for it Nathan suddenly found himself free and bearing down on goal only for the keeper to push his shot wide of the post. Undeterred, another break saw Simon F receive the ball just inside the 25. Again, burning the defender for pace, his initial shot was partly parried by the goalkeeper, but Nathan bursting forward to beat his marker to the ball was unlucky to see his follow up effort slide just wide of the left hand post. It was surely only a matter of time before the equaliser came?
It was and it came in the same manner as the first. A poor clearance from Peterborough was intercepted in midfield and pinged about to Simon Jelley in space. His through ball cut the defence in two and found Simon F in space. Collecting the ball on the run, he waited for the onrushing keeper to commit, then tucked the ball under his falling body to bring the scores level once more at 2-2. This then spurred the Peterborough lads into life and the scores only remained level for a short while before a third was scored from a short corner.
Peterborough's young team then endeared themselves to the South defence in particular, by owning up to an errant foot in the build up to what could have been a fourth goal for them. The number 6 admitted his guilt to the umpires and the goal was chalked off for which the lad was nominated for a MoM award in the pub afterwards among the other general nods of appreciation to the young side. Would it prove to be costly though as try as they might, they could not find the two goal cushion to help see off South?
Further chances came and went for both sides. Nathan had another glorious chance to get his name on the scoresheet as again his pace took him clear of his man and into space, only to see his shot just fall the wrong side of the post. Simon F also spurned the chance of a first hat-trick for South, when finding himself once more with only the Peterborough keeper to beat, manged to only hit the keepers pads when perhaps the ball (and the glory) could have been passed to someone with a better angle to finish. However, no further goals came and 2-3 was the final score.
A win for Peterborough was probably the right result. They had the better opportunities and the skill and fitness to make better use of them. However, South produced a great performance that had it come on the back of two games as scheduled, would probably have given them the additional match sharpness to take one or two of the lost efforts to have possibly stolen one or even all three points. Its a shame that this season, they've come up against a team of such experience and skill as Cambridge City 5s when only one team gets to be promoted from 6NWS. 
However, I'm sure with time a lot of these players will be playing in higher leagues with Peterborough's other teams.","Men's 4ths lose to City of Peterborough 8","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

A full squad to choose from also added to the positive atmosphere as we lined up to start the game and aim to take the game to the opposition from the off.
Of course, best laid plans and all that...the opposition obviously had the same idea and came flying forward from the pushback. South were immediately on the defensive and as a result failed to get a grip on the midfield. Too often we were forced to react rather than getting on the front foot and attacking. The pressure of playing against a team who needed a win as badly as we did was telling and whenever we could get the ball, it was surrendered too easily either through a misplaced pass or by being closed down and forced into turning the ball over. Soon enough we found ourselves 0-1 down and chasing the game, as we tried to find a way back in to the game, we got caught a second time and the score was 0-2 to the opposition.
The second goal seemed to wake us up. Slowly we managed to assert ourselves on the game, starting from the back. Charlie and Dave managed to get a grip on things at the back with Ky and David providing support on the flanks. Balls were finding their way higher up the pitch as Simon J and Wilco were creating spaces by pulling the Bourne players this way and that, and with willing running on the flanks from Tom R and Nathan M to support Boris and Simon up front, who were finally starting to see some of the play. When the ball could be worked through from the back, we were able to start playing our own game and pop the ball about. When nothing obvious was on, we were able to clear our lines by getting the ball launched clear of our half to allow us to regroup, push up and start defending from much higher up the pitch instead of being camped in our own half.
In fact, one such clearance from the Monckasaurus was smashed through a gap in the midfield towards the opposition 25. Simon peeled off to the right aiming to force the covering defender into commiting to challenge Boris for the ball or track his run. In fact, he did neither allowing Boris to flick his stick at the ball as it passed the 25 yard line and
spoon the ball up into the D. The goalkeeper got caught in two minds trying to deal with the ball and with pressure from Simon following up and sniffing around, he mistimed the clearing kick and the ball flicked off the rear of his pad and into the goal. 1-2 and South's tails were up. South went straight for it again from the restart and managed to force some short corners but no more goals came for either side and Bourne held their lead going into the half time break.
After a frank exchange of views, battle was rejoined with the opposition and South went for it immediately. While it wasn't going all our own way, we did manage to spend the majority of the opening exchanges pouring forward into Bourne's half. More short corners were won but through a combination of sloppy play and stout defending, no chances were taken. In fact, while chances were appearing quite frequently the Bourne defence were defending for their lives and through their own version of the Monckasaurus, clearing their lines effectively to set up quick counter attacks of their own. However, some solid defending all round, particularly with some fantastic tracking back from all the guys in midfield to help out kept the scoreline at 1-2 right into the final 10 minutes.
And what a final 10 minutes! A series of substitutions saw South start to boss the game across the park and get a stranglehold on the game. A slick set of passes saw the ball passed swiftly from the back as a Bourne attack was broken up by Dave who fed the ball to Simon J. A 1-2 with Ian bypassed the danger men in midfield before releasing Boris with a peachy cross field ball to get the forwards in behind the Bourne defence. Simon F came charging forward in support and as Boris reached the 25 yard line, he drew the last defender and slipped the ball into Simon's path for him to collect, steady and cooly slide the ball to the left of the keeper to bring the scores level at 2-2.
Bourne kept pushing forward looking for another goal, but were being kept at bay by some fantastic defensive work. This desperation to find another goal saw the game stretched and much more open. As a result, another quick counter attack following a Bourne attack being broken up saw Boris again in acres of space on the right as the ball was played in behind the last defender. Bearing down on goal and with only the keeper to beat, Boris selflessly squared the ball to Simon F who tucked the ball away through the goalkeppers diving legs to take the lead for the first time. 3-2 South with 5 minutes or so left to go.
But still we weren't quite finished. As Bourne started to push higher and higher, they over commited men time and again and as attacks broke down. Simon and Boris were finding time and space to try their luck again. This time Simon collected the outlet ball as it came forward and took of for the opposition goal and looking to draw the last defender away before feeding Boris in and attempting to return the favour. However, the attack broke down and South were left to defend the final few minutes as Bourne searched in vain for an equaliser.
So a vital win against a team also desperate for points at the wrong end of the table, saw the 4s stretch their unbeaten run to 3 games and opened up a 5 point gap on Ely and a 6 point gap on Bourne below them while moving within a point of St Neots 4s above us. Everyone put in a shift today and an enjoyable result was made all the sweeter by the manner in which we stuck with our game plan and worked our way back into the game by playing to our strengths; working the ball around to players in space, making moves to create that space and loose their marker and above all fighting for every ball right to the final minute. Lets keep it up through the friendly next week and into the final two league games against Peterborough Vets and Ely 4s. Happy days!

A goodly bunch of subs including James Mathews making his debut in the South midfeld and a rare (this season) run out for Jacon VDM saw South start with confidence in extending their unbeaten run of 4 games to 5. Eyeing up some of the opposition, the conclusion was that South would need to remember to play to their strengths; ball retention, good movement off the ball to allow some simple passing of the ball to retain possession and wear them down over the course of the game.
Right from the pushback, South immediately took the game to their opposition and spent pretty much the entire first quarter of the game camped in Peterboroughs half of the pitch. Some strong running from Tom R and Rasmus on the flanks providing width and allowing Wilco and Jacob to dominate the midfield. The defense were largely underemployed except to collect and mop up some panicky clearances and set up a fresh wave of attacks. When Peterborough started to work the ball forward more carefully, the wall provided by Dave and Charllie in the centre and Howard and David blocking and picking off runs/passes on the flanks, saw South looking very comfortable.
Boris had the first opportunity for South as a ball was worked around the midfield and dropped back to Dave who started playing higher up the pitch as Peterborough were hemmed in. Dave smashed the ball forward for the bearded vice skipper to fetch in the D. Boris got a reversed flick that went narrowly wide of the left hand post, but South&#39;s tails were definitely up. More chances were carved out as the half progressed, but nothing really troubling the keeper or defence as South struggled to find space to get the killer pass or shot away.
As the half drew to a close, Peterborough started to get into the game themselves and were finding themselves gettin further and further towards the South goal. It wasn&#39;t long before they started to create their own chances, but some stout defending and some good stops/saves from Shahzad kept them at bay. It seemed that no-one was going to create a truly clear cut chance as half-time approached, until the South skipper decided enough was enough. Collecting the ball on the 25 yard line from Jacob, Simon took on two defnders and jinked left and right to get into the D and make space for a shot. Breaking free and with Peterborough&#39;s handy sweeper No 5 desperately trying to close him down, he cracked a shot at the right hand post that couldnt beat the keeper and the rest of the half went by without further incident or anyone opening the scoring for either team.
After debating the formation of the opposition (the skipper suspected that a 6 man defence was being used owing to the lack of space/time available to South&#39;s forwards) and declaring that the game was there for the taking as older legs tired towards the end of the game, South came straight back out for the second half and looking keen to find that all important opening goal. Everything seemed to look good for South until a literal as well as metaphorical blow threatened to disrupt the gameplan when the Monckasaurus took a mighty blow to the hand that forced him out of the game. Reshuffling the defence, South had to adjust quickly before Peterborough realised what was going on and took advantage.
As it turned out, South coped better with the enforced change and after clearing the restarted ball quickly got organised and won a sideline ball near their 25. Spotting a lot of available space on that left hand side, the skipper encouraged a quick self take from Tom to make use of the space. Seizing the opportunity, Tom took off and carried the ball right up to the opposition 25, dancing and jinking past two or three Peterborough players before sliding the ball across to Boris who had dragged two defenders across to the right. Boris then took those players out of the game by pinging a first time ball into the D for John to chase. A first time shot was stopped by the keeper, but the South striker followed up and coolly tucked the loose ball away to put South 1-0 up.
This seemed to wake Peterborough up as they then started to exert more pressure on South and look for an equaliser. South&#39;s defence was standing firm though and the reshuffled back line were doing a terrific job of keeping the visitors at bay. However a series of short corners against South chipped away at our resolve until eventually despite several stops/blocks and last ditch tackles, the ball found its way through a crowd of players and the scores were level.
There were further chances for both sides and Peterborough did have another short corner strike ruled out, but both defences seemed to be winning their battles agaisnt the respective attacks. The final 10 minutes or so turned into a real end to end game as first one defence would set up a counter that would be foiled and instantly reversed by the other team, seemingly bypassing the midfield. None more so than when Charlie decided to keep bombing forward from the back to try and find that winning goal for South but all too soon, the final whistle came and both sides had to settle for their second 1-1 draw of the season.
All in all, a good game against experienced opposition and South did extend their run to 5 games unbeaten as they looked to finish their season strongly.

As it turned out we needn't have worried.
Right from the start, South dominated the play, keeping possession well and knocking the ball around with a confidence that helped to settle the nerves. 
Johnson (F), newly positioned at centre mid to fill in for Mark 'no show' Williams, gave a commanding performance (literally), while up front, the new wingers Halse and Haslop, demonstrated some smart thinking and swift feet to cause the opposition all sorts of problems. 
The back four of Parsot, Graveling, Aston and Wych mopped up any opposition attacks and set the tone for South's passing game, distributing the ball to all corners, while Hawkes and Chalk provided both width and some telling passes to slice through Stortford's defence. What little work was left for Parker in goal, was dealt with comfortably. 
After several promising attacks, South's first goal was as simple as it gets. Having been awarded a free hit just outside the 25, McCulloch, all alone in the D, called for a quick ball to be played in. Then yelled for it again. Then finally resorted to begging. Just as McCulloch was considering what bribes to offer, Johnson, who had been hovering over the ball all this time (presumably engaging in banter of some sort), finally relented and slapped the ball through to (the incredibly still unmarked) McCulloch who justified all the nagging for the ball by calmly deflecting it past the keeper into the goal. 
At half time the score was still 1-0 and and the heat and lack of fitness was starting to take its toll. But South regrouped and started the 2nd half strongly, with McCulloch's sky-high aerial push-back (new rules!) to the opposition (as it was a friendly) being variously described as 'gloriously sublime' and 'disgusting and embarrassing'. I think we all know the truth... 
There was plenty of time in the 2nd half for South to show more flair. Johnson got on the score sheet, pouncing on a loose clearance in the D to smash the ball back past the hapless keeper and make it 2-0. Parsot, presumably taking a leaf out of the 'Bristowes Guide to Sweeping' book (God help us all if that ever becomes a reality!), managed to hit the air just above the ball so hard a small crack appeared in the space-time continuum. Wych, clearly feeling smug at his evident superior fitness, proceeded to abandon his centre back role in favour of doing shuttle runs up and down the pitch, on two occasions finding himself with the ball in the opposition's D with just the keeper to beat. Needless to say, the score remained the same. And presently, with unusual generosity, South gifted Bishop's Stortford a goal to give them a glimmer of hope. 
Which was quickly dashed by the ever-sneaky Virdi (on for 'Rub my groin' Haslop). A fine diagonal ball in from Hawkes found Virdi at the far post and, as the keeper lunged, he deftly started to flick the ball past him into the far corner. I say 'started' because this was truly the slowest goal-bound shot ever played. Never before has a South player attempted to 'run the clock down' and score a goal *at the same time*. It's not confirmed but I believe Virdi had time to pat himself on the back and high-five at least 3 of the watching 2nds before turning back to see the ball roll across the goal line. 
And so it finished 3-1. South 1sts are UNBEATEN THIS SEASON. A really solid performance by the whole team, which bodes well for a great season. ","Men's 1sts beat Bishop's Stortford 3","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

The 1s Vs the 2s. What a great advert for CSHC whether youre interested in a young bachelor or a silver fox it was all on offer.
The stands at the fortress Leys were packed out overflowing with female talent. Highly distracting if you ask me
So the message from the captain as we set off to battle was the same boring one as it always is. Dont get caught too high up the field.. blady blady bla
Ignoring the captain, my thoughts were lets smash em, get stuck in and show em how its done at the top of the league. 
So the game started and its fair to say they put up a resistance but we had the lions share of the ball. Rich Claes was doing a Darkness tribute band proud on the left, Christian Pearson and Laurie Haslop took it in turns to harvest on the right while the captain was making loud noises in the middle. Opportunities came and went, what can only be described as a platter of chances was presented to the forwards mentioned above yet to no prevail. The biggest of the 3 dinner plate opportunities was place in front of Rich. Not sure he came up with a valid excuse, either he was day dreaming and reliving his rock concert from the night before or he simply didn't feel like crushing his club mates in the opening quarter.
Jack Chalk spent a lot of the time on the floor during this game but it was he who fired in the first goal by putting a dangerous ball into the D from outside the 25, the ball was moving far too quick for the waft of David Aston but it reached the prostrate keeper, just clipped him and glanced underneath. (The important word being glanced). Own goal .. one nil  or maybe not; to keep it friendly Aston didnt bother to celebrate the goal and as the umpire was unsighted it couldnt be given. 
John Hawkes was right in amongst it troubling the 2s, flicking at goal, dribbling through the midfield all the while ranting on about X factor. All great to see and hear John but still no goals this season maybe a bit more practice is in order rather than watching Strictly Come Dancing..
No offence to Paresh Parsot, Chris Gravling, Dave Aston, and Matt Readman but I dont think they offered enough excitement to get a mention in this match report. Their defending was textbook and they snuffed out any glimmer of an opportunity the 2s had. George Wych however with his current purple patch tears up the field on a weekly basis; this week was no exception schooling half the 2s before teeing up a forward.
Is this the strongest back line CSHC have ever put on show?
The coveted goal came early on in the second half. I was involved (standard) it came from a short corner, a bit of inspiration and Rich C was there to lift it over the log on the goal line. 
And that was about it. Some players shook hand afterwards others didn't. Some showered some didn't. The majority went to tee's at the red bull, ate a few slices, drank a few beers.some went out on the lash others didn't. Some drank too much and donned womens clothing for warmth others didn't. Some went home with .. others didn't.
The 2s will come to training with their heads held high and rightly so. We have a strong squad of club members at the moment but it is Cambridges finest 11 that march on another business like game. We're top of the league and that where we'll stay!

The team has its main characters from last season, but has been strengthened by some very welcome additions, such as Jack Chalk and Bhav Virdi. New additions to the club also that played brilliantly today were Dave Halse and Oli Culley. 
The first half featured no goals, but South had many good chances, Dom Nelson and Nick Venner put a nice move together, while Andy Fraser showed he's ready to play at this level, putting in impressive runs down the right wing and keeping a good width that opened up the centre of the pitch. Stortford midfielders were perhaps given a bit too much room and a couple of defensive blunders (in an otherwise solid and composed display, particularly from Richard Morgan) let their potentially dangerous forwards in for a couple of chances, but the ever reliable Shabaz Ali in goal made light work of any attack that made it through.
Following on from a decent half time team talk by the captain Ron Oren the team stepped up a gear and played some very impressive attacking play, making mincemeat of the opponents. Players were stepping away from their markers allowing some nice passing moves. A lot of running and energy from the midfielders and attackers led to a rout of goals evenly spread though out the second half. Nick Venner scored an impressive hat trick (which duly earned him Lemon of the Match for unnecesssary showboating), the pick of which was a solo effort where he collected the ball on the half way line and beat the keeper in style, having left a couple of defenders in his wake. Two goals were also had by Dom Nelson, and one each from Chris Walsh and Dave, all deserved scorers to what was an all round and surprisingly sprightly game by the 2nds.

The match was a return of last seasons friendly, when a combined 3s/4s team had made the journey down the M11 only to suffer a 5-1 reverse against a strong Stortford 5s side. With a full 3s team available this year sweet revenge was on the agenda at the inaugural match on the newly resurfaced Wilby pitch.
Straight out of the blocks South were looking dangerous. Playing the familiar 4-3-3, the midfield were pressing high and full backs Neil Sneade and Ian Glover were able to bomb down the flanks. The rewards were quick to come as David Doup opening the seasons account with a firm finish.
Newly installed in the 3s attack, Rob Barton didnt take long to join him, starting his campaign to reclaim his Goal King crown. Next it was Tom Souths turn to join the party, the ball being immediately worked forward from the push back for him to add the third. The match threatened to turn into a rout as Rob followed up with two more goals for a first-half hatrick and David added his second to put the free-scoring 3s 6-0 up after just twenty minutes.
The momentum was halted though when, eager to get in on the goal-scoring action, Neil made a bid for the title of first hockey player to test the new own goal rule. A hopeful hit was cracked into the D by Stortford and with confusion between goalkeeper Steve Parker and defender, Neils attempted block succeeded only in deflecting the ball into his own net.
Half time was reached without further score as South were guilty of taking their foot off the gas and indulging in a bit of showboating, abandoning some of their earlier pass and move hockey. The ball did find its way into Souths net once more but off the thigh of a Stortford forward to see the goal ruled out.
As the sides changed ends, Stortford were evidently heartened by the bone thrown them by Neils generous deflection and came out with much greater composure and determination. Their midfield playmaker was getting more of the ball and playing in their wide players, denying Souths full backs the freedom they had enjoyed in the first period. While not exactly laying siege to Souths goal, the match was definitely looking much more evenly balanced.
Having ridden the Stortford surge, when it eventually came the opening goal of the second period went to South, a clipped shot from Stu Creed finding the far corner of the goal. Not to be deterred, Stortfords improved second half performance was rewarded with a goal. A shot from the right of the D looked to be covered by Steve only for the ball to squeeze between his kickers and thud against the backboard.
It proved a false dawn though as South reasserted themselves through hard work in the middle from new captain Ali Edge and old captain Simon Jelley, protecting Paul South and JB in the centre of the South defence. With returnee Simon Ta doing great work down the right flank, two more goals from Rob were rounded off with a final strike from Tom to bring up double figures as well as a doubling of the previous years scoreline.
A great start to the season for South 3s. With a few faces still to return, good availability and a regular team should hopefully see this squad prove strong enough maintain their position in Div 5NW this season.","Men's 3rds thrash Bishop's Stortford 5","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

With new starters Andy T and Sam R introduced and the warm welcome extended to 'El Presidente' Greaves, Ian E and Wilco joining us for the new season the 4s took the field full of confidence and it showed through the opening stages. Slick passing moves allowed us to make good use of Sam and Nathan's pace on the wings and with tenacious tackling from Wilco and last years Player of the Season Simon Frampton filling in in midfield the game was if not firmly, then fairly under our control.

One such foray forward saw the midfield swapping passes before unleashing Sam down the right flank and after taking on the opposition left back, cut inside the D and unleashed a rocket of a shot across the keeper and into the far corner. 1-0 South! With the rolling substitutions working well and several more well struck shots testing the opposition keepers luck more than his judgement, it started to look like Shahbaz in the 4s goal was going to be well rested before his afternoon game with the 2s.

Then came the tactical manouever that changed the course of the game. Such a pity it came from Stortford's captain rather than yours truly. Pushing their guest player forward from defence to midfield, she (yes, that's not a typo, she) began to boss the game and leave the midfield chasing shadows for much of the rest of the game. Combined with some fast and skilful wingplay, the pressure soon told and the equaliser duy arrived. However, South weren't to roll over and just before half time, the Monckasaurus dispatched one of his customary cross field balls out to the right which the Monckaraptor swiftly latched onto, driving for the baseline and cutting a ball back that only the timely intervention of the Stortford sweeper prevented from reaching Boris and James lurking in the D.

The second half came and started much as the first half ended and South found themselves behind for the first time. Despite renewed pressure, typified by the constant running on the flanks from Sam and Nathan (ablely assisted by Owen and Boris) looking to help set up attacks, South managed to force several short corners, but were unable to dispatch any. However, getting to grips with Stortford's midfield and repelling the attacks that came through, the defence stood firm to keep the game tight and several good stops from Shahbaz prevented them from adding to their score.

In in all, a good start (despite the result) showing a lot of promise for the season. If the availability is kept up and with our natural midfield players yet to return, this could be a good season ahead.

Once Shahbaz and Joe were organised with whistles and David B and Simon J had donned black tops to round out the sides to 11 a-side, everyone decided to get stuck in to ward off the chill and a frenetic opening ensued with both teams attacking with gusto.
It wasn't long before South started to exert control over the game and began to play their customary passing game, pinging the ball about to players in space and working the channels well. It wasn't long before the first openings were forged as first John, then Simon failed to gather through balls and then Boris was narrowly off-target as South set about testing the strength of the Shefford defence. We weren't getting it all our own way though as the younger members of the opposition were proving to be both nimble and skillful in working their own opportunities to test us.
South werent to be denied though and the first goal came from a most unexpected source. Breaking up one such attack, Charlie went on a barm-storming run from the right back position and flew past several players as he bombed forward. Ignoring Boris's call for a ball into the corner, he feinted inside of David B as he approached the 25 and slipped a ball through a crowd of players into the skipper's path at the top of the D where it was squeezed between the post and the keeper's outstretched kicker to open the scoring. 1-0 South.
Sensing more goals, South went searching for more but owing to a combination of wayward passing and shooting, miscommunication between players as to where the runner/pass was going, a goalie and defence determined to thwart South at every opportunity, nothing seeme to be quite going right. The Leys also appeared to be having something of a hoo-doo on short-corners for South too as several went awry with the normally straight-forward routine reminscient of the 3s vs 4s derby at the end of last season when the 3s appeared to prefer to stop their routines somewhere near the halfway line. We weren't at that stage, but we certainly made life hard for ourselves by failing to get many decent shots away, although Boris was inches away from a connection on one Monckasaurus bullet that whistled past the post.
Shefford were creating chances though as they contained several useful players who were able to patiently craft opportunities to pull players out of position and play in the younger players to run at Charlie and Ky in the full back positions while dragging Tom and Dave left, right and centre to try and create space. With these attacks looking more and more ominous, coupled with our inability to convert the many chances we created ourselves, we suddenly found ourselves pegged back as Shefford scored an equaliser which seemed to come from somewhere on the left following a crafty through ball from Simon J. 
Without taking our foot of the gas, South immediately went searching for a second to regain control. Good distribution from Charlie and Ky at the back kept releasing Boris and Tom R on the wings to run at and behind the opposition and work the ball forwards. Ian and Wilco started to dominate the midfield again and the passing game was restored. All that was required was for John and Simon to create the spaces required to open up the Shefford defence again. Several opportunities came and went before the breakthrough came, right on the stroke of half time. A break down South's left saw Ky brong the ball forward before releasing Tom R who found a cross that was cut back to Wilco. An exchange of passes with Ian, saw the good doctor break into the D and show some fancy foot and stick work to create enough space to fire a shot past the keeper to regain the lead. 2-1 South.
A slight rejig of the line up at half time saw the arriving Andy T arrive to take over duties on the right to keep Simon J quiet, while Boris switched to the left and Tom R dropped into the right back position. Charlie moved alongside Dave M in the centre of defence while Tom P was summoned to something essential in Royston. The skipper ordered more of the same from the first half (with less of the wayward passing/finishing) and politely declined Boris' offer to help bolster the midfield. There were goals in this game and the skipper was determined to help himself to as many as possible (all in the cause of another resounding win for the team of course!)
The rejigged formation at the back proved something of a revelation. Tom R in particular earned himself a couple of MoM nominations for his uncanny abiliity to spot and cut out dangerous attacks from the right back spot and as Shefford went searching for a second equaliser, both Dave and Charlie were finding themselves heading further and further up the pitch. In fact, Dave's booming passes were in danger of becoming booming shots as he got ever closer to the opposition 25 and it was only due to some unfortunate miscalculations that at least one wasn't deflected into the goal as the Shefford goal came under aerial bombardment. That aerial bombardment was aided more literally by Boris as on at least two occasions he swept forward from the left wing towards the D before smashing some interesting (and unfortunately illegal) shot-cum-crosses across the D. Once more, he enquired if the skipper would like to try his hand at it and was again politely declined. Shefford are a good side though and were still in the game. A series of short corners was won, but without being able to convert any it was becoming clearer that the next goal scored would be key. The only question would be, who'd get it?
It turned out to be the home side and from the customary source. After fluffing his lines on several earlier opportunities to collect and gather the meaty through balls from the back, Simon F finally found himself i enough time and space to trap one on the edge of the 25 that the last defender failed to cut out. Turning and driving into the D, a truly unique event happened for this season. As the onrushing keeper came out to close the angles and hurry the skipper up, Simon calmly stepped to the right and hit (yes, hit - if you've seen him in training or at pay and play you'll understand that a hit is never used when a simple push will do) an absolute thunderbolt across the keeper and into the left hand corner. 3-1 South.
Flushed with success and confidence, the skipper went sniffing around for his (first for South) hat-trick and came remarkably close. Another ball was fired through towards the right hand corner and collected by the skipper who this time tried to turn provider, crossing the ball into the D for the onrushing John G. A despairing lunge from the covering defender span the ball away from the South man but still spinning ever goalwards, the post rattled, the goalie dived backwards to reach the ball before the follow up from Greaves could be tucked away and the whistle sounded. After much confusion and discussion it transpired that Shahbaz had whistled before the ball had crossed the line thinking that the inside of the post had been struck rather than the front of the post and so the ball was declared dead and a free hit given to the opposition.
South were not to be denied a further goal for long though and following a series of short corners that were a definite improvement on the first half, the final game came through an intriguing set play that will need to be remembered for the future. After a miserable effort at the previous corner had failed to yield the hat-trick goal, the skipper informed the Monckasaurus: ""Don't worry about getting it to me, if you have a shot, take it."". Unbeknownst to him, Messrs Greaves and Lossy were concocting their own plan. Switching to let John take over as injector, Boris trotted back to the left of the D with an exchange of winks. As the party at the top of the D settled to receive the ball, the ball was slipped short to Boris who fired a cracking shot behind the defenders and across the startled keepers boughs into the far corner of the net. 4-1 South
And that was how it stayed. 4-1 was adjudged to be a harsh result on Shefford who in truth were dangerous throughout and created many opportunities. The teams were very evenly matched and the game was a very enjoyable affair played in good spirits throughout. Always a pleasure to play and we'd look forward to further matches next season, if they can be arranged.","Men's 4ths beat Shefford & Sandy 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

Although these pre-season matches are generally seen as fairly unimportant, this week would be different. Firstly it was Dave Aston's 100th game for the club, with a record of P100 W53 D 14 L33 which is a great achievement and well worthy of being given the honour of taking the kit bag home. However, a mere century of games was nothing compared to the Really Important thing that happened, something Truly Extraordinary - but that came later on.
The sun was mercilessly hot, with not a cloud in the sky - to such an extent that the umpires had to make a pre-game decision on whether Pearson on safety grounds should be allowed to play. However, after much deliberation they could not be sure that he was actually ginger (and therefore ineligible to play in full sunlight) and so South were able to take to the field with a full contingent.
To add to the intense heat, there was also a combine harvester working the next-door field, sending great clouds of dust over the pitch every time it went past. South took to the conditions the better in the opening stages, the team ""combining"" well to ""harvest"" a couple of goals before half time. (Get it? ""Combine"" + ""Harvester""? That's clever don't you think?). First up was a good move down the right, involving Parsot and Johnson. The ball was moved on to McCulloch who cracked in a great ball for Pearson at the far post to sweep in first touch.
By now South were dominating the game. Johnson and Hawkes were full of running in midfield and with Readman and Wych commanding the centre of defence there was time and space for Aston to put in one of his trademark sprints up the left wing, moving the ball on superbly for McCulloch again to set up a goal, this time a cross in for the left which Halse sprinted onto and tucked neatly under the keeper from the reverse side. A great goal - his first for the Mens 1st XI.
Two-nil at half time and the Captain was full of praise for the team's effort. Although South were having most of the game, this was a far better Phoenix team than the one demolished earlier in the day by the Men's 2nd XI but the South midfield in particular were putting in a great shift to keep the opposition in check.
The second half continued in much the same vein. The continued heat and dust perhaps contributed to a slowing down from the away side and South pressed forward in search of more goals but were not to be successful. Some good chances came and went - and in the final minute we almost had the ending that everyone wanted but the opposition keeper made a great save from Aston's well hit shot and we had to settle for a 2-0 result.
Still, the Men's 1st XI's unbeaten season continues and the only player leaving the pitch dissatisfied was Parker, who had not had to put any of his new GK kit to use - having not had a shot to save all match. On this evidence, South will be a tough club to beat - the M1 v M2 derby is going to be interesting!
And there was still time for that Amazing Event to take place. Perhaps it was to honour Aston's 100th game. Perhaps the heat had got to him. Or perhaps he had taken a shine to one of the opposition players. Whatever the reason, <b>McCulloch took a post-match shower.</b> Unbelievable maybe but we have witnesses that it did happen. Unfortunately the event got to McCulloch to such an extent that he was unable to come to post-match teas but we enjoyed the pizza anyway.
<small>PS: Regular readers of this column may feel short changed at the lack of Aston-bashing this week. As the guy has just celebrated 100 games for the club it was decided to call a truce for this week. Don't worry, normal service will be resumed next week.</small>

The day started at the crack of dawn as the 2s made their way down to the newly improved University pitch to dust off their sticks and prove to themselves that the pre-season training that they had neglected to do would have been a waste of time anyway.
From the off it was clear that South were the better team immediately putting the pressure on and scoring 3 goals in the space of 5 minutes: 2 from Virdi and 1 from Johnson, all 3 with the same clinical manner of artfully breaking away from the defence with some slick 2-touch hockey. The game then settled down with the partnership of Walsh and Snetler dominating the midfield and effortlessly moving the ball from one side of the pitch to the other. Watson then followed up with the 4th goal of the half with a miss-hit down the middle of the goal which the goalie took pity on and allowed to go in. Clapp scored the final goal of the half with some great interlinking forward play with Johnson that allowed the ball to be slotted in at the far post.
The half-time team talk was strangest that the 2s have ever encountered with Ron Oren literally lost for words as he struggled to think up some bad things to say about how his team had being playing. In fact the best thing that he could think up to describe his teams dominating performance was that wasnt actually that bad. So spurred on by their captains inspiring speech the 2s went on to not play too badly in the second half either.
In the second half it was clear that some of the defenders were losing their patience at barely touching the ball; in fact sweeper Oli Culley didnt touch the ball at all in the first half. So when opportunities came in the second half it was not uncommon to see defenders charging like wild rhinoceroses up the field. In one particular incident Dom Nelson charged the whole length of the pitch in a counter attack from one D to the other only for the ball to be passed to Snetler to score with a deadly, unstoppable reverse hit.
The second half went on largely the same as the first half had done with South easily enjoying 70% of possession with some great play all round with defenders, midfielders and strikers linking well. It seemed as though Phoenix had only 1 good player and Walsh, doing what any good enforcer would, eliminated him from the game. In fact the game looked over by the time that South had reached 10-0 with Watson and Snetler completing their hat-tricks, but there was one more surprise left in store. An event only dreamed about by some and a dream given up on by others was still to occur. A first goal in 3 years from the man some are calling The Heskey of Defence, TOM ANNS!!! It was the goal that every player dreams of scoring: Anns picks the ball up on the edge of the D sets himself and rockets the ball straight for the top corner. However a defender happened to be in the way, so it took a deflection and bounced through the goalies legs and trickled into the backboard.
Ron Oren wasnt too pleased with an 11-0 victory saying how the 2s needed to play much better when they come up against better opposition however he was completely ignored as the 2s reflected on a great game and a deserved scoreline that will probably be their biggest win of the season.

And were not just talking about the barbecue weather: for the second week in a row Cambridge South M3s ran in double figures to get their season off to the most smoking of sizzling starts.
With the sun blazing down on a 1pm push back, captain Ali Edges pre-match mantra was conservation of effort. Embracing this philosophy perhaps a little too whole-heartedly, South started with a sluggish muddle-headedness that suggested theyd already been baking their brains in the sun for a couple of hours. 
Mere minutes into the match, positional dilettantism and a reluctance to exceed walking pace combined to leave South overloaded down their left flank. Phoenix attacked, using their extra man on the right to bypass Neil Sneade at left back before crossing the ball for an unmarked forward to sweep the ball past Shahbaz Ali in the South goal from close range. Not an auspicious start.
Fortunately, this provided the necessary kick up the arse for the visitors. Although still struggling to cover Phoenixs right side effectively, South gradually worked themselves back into the game. Several good moves down the South right from Jan Brynjolffssen on to Andrew Fraser and finally to Russell Johnson (playing his second game on one of the hottest days of the year) produced threatening runs into the D but the final ball was elusive. The equaliser did eventually come from Souths right winger, Russ reacting first to collect a loose ball in the D and calmly scoop it home.
In what was still an even contest, South were having to work hard in the blazing heat to try and establish an advantage. Captain Ali was leading by example, putting in a shift to shuttle between his position at left wing and covering the midfield. Particularly notable was his cunning use of the only available piece of shade, taking the opportunity during an injury break to crouch carefully in the 2 square shadow cast by one of the floodlights! His effort was nearly rewarded following another lung-bursting charge into the Phoenix D as an attack apparently broke down. With no whistle and the play still live, Ali knocked the ball home only to see the latest of late decisions rub his score out.
It was deep into the first period before the visitors finally got ahead, goals from Tom South and Rob Barton seeing South reach the gratefully anticipated break with a solid if not commanding lead. The half time team talk was conducted in the few square inches of shade afforded by the pitch-side rabbit hutches that double as dug-outs at the Four Releet pitch, with the message being one of perseverance and trying to avoid passing out with heat stroke.
The third quarter produced a mirror image of the second, with South generally in the ascendant but the game remaining close and competitive. The notable feature of this passage of play was a spectacular free hit from Jan on the 25 yard lane, playing a long ball which caught the defence on the hop and almost resulted in a breakaway goal from the attackers. Unfortunately it was on Phoenixs 25 yard line, the hit was straight back towards the South goal and it was JB and Neil who were left scrambling to intercept the onrushing Phoenix forwards. Were sure it was just Jans careful plan to keep Souths defence on its toes
Having survived the self-inflicted scare, as in the first half it was South who took the initiative with another brace of goals, Rob and then Russ each notching their second. With the result now out of sight and the sun remaining relentless in its intensity, Phoenixs will seemed to fade along with their bodies. The final 15 minutes saw waves of South attacks as tired passes from Phoenix presented the visitors with the ball and weary legs were having difficulty covering the runners.
The sixth goal was gifted to Tom, his penetrating run being ended with Russ calling in space to his right only for the defender to promptly give with ball straight back for Tom to finish. Jammy bugger. Next it was Matt Kerns turn to get in on the action, a well worked South move finishing with Matt skilfully deflecting a mid-air ball in from close range. Rob and Tom then took turns to complete their hat-tricks but the final score of the day went to Souths own flying right back, Jan abandoning any pretence of defensive restraint to arrive in the D to put the finish to yet another sequence of South passing.
Both weary sides were glad to hear the final whistle, Phoenix possibly a little more so, and head for the welcoming showers. Late bids for Lemon were put in by Andrew, donning his casual shorts over the top of the playing shorts he had showered in, resulting in a large and conspicuous wet patch spreading across his groin, and Tom, who had to be dressed by his dad after failing to bring a change of shirt.

Faced with sweltering temperatures and the sun high in the sky, the toss was won, and the decision was made by the captain - for some reason - to swap sides. Good work by the central midfield of Ian Marshman, James Bridge, and Wilco provided South with some good chances in the first half, and two of these early on in the piece would have been certain goals if it wasn't for the Phoenix goalkeeper who was far too good to be playing at this level. Despite the domination, some poor marking allowed Phoenix to pick up the ball, dribble it into the South circle, and slip the ball into the corner of the goal. This was followed by more chances for South, one of which was rewarded by a short corner, in which a bobbling ball by Ian Evans was put away by Your Chairman, John Greaves. The chase for Goal King had begun, and two games into the season, Rob Barton was only 7 goals away. 
At half-time, the game looked promising, especially if the South team were to take their chances in front of goal. Unfortunately, Phoenix scored from a penalty corner, and then again, scooping the ball through a crowd, leaving Shahbaz wondering what had happened. Things looked bleak. With 15 minutes to go, the game opened up, as it so often does towards the end of 4ths games. Midfields of both teams went missing at times, which left a giant space in the middle of the park. Both teams had efforts saved, but a shot from Shahzad was tapped in at close range by James Bridge, who was accused of stealing Shahzad's goal. As we later found out from the opposition 'keeper, he would have had it covered. The final few minutes also saw a number of Cambridge South breaks, but despite the pressure, and with weary legs (some of which got in the way at crucial stages), there were no more goals to come.
The 4s would have been more pleased with a draw, considering the amount of shots that we were afforded, but most importantly, we had kept it a close game. For the league season, it is hoped that we can improve on those games lost last season by a single goal...","Men's 4ths narrowly lose to Phoenix 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

The opening twenty minutes were open but scoreless, with both sides throwing players forward; Saffron Walden had the majority of the opportunities in this period. They eventually took a deserved lead when a turnover led to an overload in our circle. Fortunately for our confidence, we were back on terms within two minutes, as Rob collected a rebound off the keeper and casually rolled the ball into the net... only for a defensive stick to appear from nowhere and stop the shot, meaning Rob had to force home on the second attempt, thereby averting any lemon nominations.
The visitors went back in front in similar circumstances to the opener, intercepting a clearance and picking out a man free in the circle, who added a neat deflected finish. Again, their lead was short lived, this time the equaliser coming from a short. The ball was worked around to Stuart, who played a marvellously perceptive reverse stick pass wide of the far post/went for a shot on the reverse stick from a ridiculous position and missed so badly that it turned into a pass (delete as you believe appropriate) which found Rob, lurking in space ready for another tap-in. It was 3-2 to us soon after, as a cross from the right from Rupert took a deflection up off a defensive stick and found Tom at the far post, who neatly deposited the flying ball into the goal.
The next goal came in what was probably the key thirty seconds of the match. Some good one-touch passing created a clear chance for Saffron Walden, but the deflected ball went just wide of the post. From the resulting 16, we worked the ball upfield and found Rob near the top of the circle. Confronted with a group of defenders and an advancing keeper, Rob went for a reverse stick sweep, got under it, and saw it lob perfectly high over the gaggle of players and drop into the net. 4-2 instead of 3-3 is a massive difference, especially when all-square would have been a fairer reflection of the balance of play.
If the first half had been competitive throughout, with both sides having a period of ascendancy, the second saw us dominate. That is not to say it was one-way traffic, Saffron Walden retained a threat up front, but we were now in control of the midfield, regularly intercepting passes and otherwise turning over the visitors attempts to clear their lines. As a result a steady stream of chances were created, with the Saffron Walden keeper the busiest man on the pitch.
Goals came at regular intervals; the fifth when a wayward through-ball deflected off a defensive stick and bobbled over a further two to set Tom in the clear. He drew the keeper, rounded him and slid the ball home. Six came from a quick counter which saw the ball bouncing around in the goalmouth until it dropped to Rob on the reverse sweep, bang, goal. The seventh was our best of the game. Ali took a long corner back to Joe, who then fed Rupert on the byline. Ruperts cross to the back post was neatly converted by Olly, who had got in front of his marker to gain the space to deflect home. The eighth came from another counter-attack. The initial circle incursion was broken up by the Saffron Walden defence, only for the ball to run kindly to Tom for a simple finish inside the unguarded near post.
There were other near things, Ali off the outside of the post, Tom having a shot smothered by the keeper, Ali having the ball plucked from his stick as he was about to finish (by a teammate!), but that was the limit of the scoring. Probably a perfect friendly, as the team improved over the course of the match. Our communication wasnt great in the first half, which created disorganisation at the back that Saffron Walden exploited. When we got talking more in the second period, we looked much more solid defensively and fluent in attack. Lesson learned, and so on? Hope so.
Next Saturday, its back to the league stuff (weather permitting) with a game against a Newmarket side that have found their feet in this Division since our last game against them, winning four straight games prior to the Christmas break. The top of the table is extremely close, with just two points covering the top four sides. All to play for in the next three months...

Slightly worried that the timing could have been better and led to some disruption of the momentum created from last weeks first point of the season, the sidelined skippers initial reaction on seeing the opposition arrive for the game was whether we'd arrived at the right game and would we be required to complete some permissions slips before push back. As it turned out, they weren't required, but Freddie Mercury (guesting for South in place of Boris
Lossey) soon informed us that we would need to ensure we stayed on the right side of ""friendly"" while being mindful of the fresh-faced opposition.
So to the game, and a much changed line-up for South who were fielding some new faces in Adam, Howard and Jason as well as several ""experienced"" senior players. It wasn't long before this started to tell as South quietly and efficiently tested the resolve of the home defence. 
It wasn't long before gaps were opened up at will by Ian and Joe in the centre with willing running from Tom and Wilco on the flanks to work the ball around the back of the home team's rear-guard. The pressure was soon turned into a goal when a delightful pass from Joe in the centre was fired to the right hand corner for the front-line to chase. 
Following up, he exchanged a quick 1-2 with Greaves Snr, who fired a low drive into the D. Freddie dummied, drawing the attention of the last man and keeper, allowing Tom the easiest of tap-ins from all of two yards that his skipper would have been grateful for had he been involved. 1-0 South.
It seemed that would open the floodgates, but to give them credit Shefford and Sandy took it on the chin and set about trying to exact their own pressure on the South backline. Time and again, some sloppy work in midfield allowed the young legs in the midfield and attack to pour forward, but the tireless work of Adam filling in at the back, ceasless tracking back from the wingers to double-team with Rasmus and David B who were playing in the full back slots, meant that John S playing at sweeper had little to do although he was more than up to the task of mopping up the few chances that snuck through.
It didnt stop South from pouring forward at every opportunity either. Time and again, short corners were won but it soon became obvious that some of our regular contributors were missing (some back up plans need to be worked on methinks) but at least we weren't producing anything quite as awful as the efforts the 3s managed in last seasons final derby. Chances were also coming from open play, but the final shot was either being expertly saved by the Shefford keeper or sheparded wide by the home defence. 1-0 it remained at half-time.
The pattern remained for the second half. Shefford and Sandy soaked up even more pressure from the South attack, while fashioning some very presentable chances of their own. It looked like 1-0 might be enough, particularly given some rather comical attacking shorts that saw Greaves Snr scampering into the D to retrieve the ball following a weak/bobbly push out in order to keep the attack alive. Greaves Jnr was dribbling through the centre at will but the moves were being snuffed out. Then up popped Freddie with 'A Kind of Magic' touch to take the ball with his back to goal, work it around the opposition defender and on to his reverse side before cracking the ball into the bottom left hand corner a la Barton.
So, the first win of the season for the 4s and hopefully, some form we can take into the league programme before it wraps up for the Christmas break. Jason and Howard made their first appearances for the club with some solid work on the wings and Adam played fantastically well at the back, earning a MoM nomination from the opposition (among others) for his tireless ability to pop-up all over the place in the 25 to make some timely interceptions.
I'd also like to thank both Shefford & Sandy's umpires for running the game. They are both new to officiating and it was universally agreed that they both had very good games, particularly the young lad who looks like he'll go far along with his playing clubmates. It'll be a pleasure to see them all again for the return fixture in the New Year.","Men's 4ths record their first win of the season at Shefford & Sandy 4","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

As the M4's long wait to their season opener goes on, the final warm up game saw us make an early start of it against Saffron Walden 6s down at the Leys. A crisp, sunny morning was greeted with enthusiasm as the squad composition led to VC Lossey suggesting an experimental 4-3-3 line up to make full use of the three forwards present. It seemed to work well early on, with some good movement pulling the suspect looking SW defence this way and that and creating some gaps that were showing good promise.
It wasn't a huge surprise when South took the lead. The ball was skilfully worked out to the right to debutant Nathan who, in turn fed the ball to Boris. Dragging three defenders wide between them, a sharp ball was whipped into the D for Captain Marvel to receive with his back to goal. Trapping and turning in one flowing motion, he made a beeline for the near post before sending a shot across the keepers pads and into the far corner to open his account for the new season and attempt to claw back some ground on Barton.
So 1-0 to South, and the foot came off the gas slightly as the unfamiliar formation also started to take its toll in midfield. SW started to exploit the gaps left in the midfield and then decided to try and make life hard for the forward line by targetting the Chairman's ankle. It was later claimed in the pub that several members of the defence had no idea he was down as there had been 'no screaming or rolling around' but with John taking a short break, the Monckasaurus was deployed from the bench (after locating the contents of his kit bag), Ian E was pushed forward to create a four man midfield and the traditional 4-4-2 was resumed along with a near stranglehold on the game for the majority of the first half time that remained.
Alas, it was too good to be true and after suddenly finding both the Captain and VC on the sidelines, the equaliser came. Rectifying the mistake by slotting the captain back into midfield for Ian E, some balance was restored but then on the stroke of half-time another short was awarded against South, was duly dispatched, and the half closed with South 2-1 down.
Battle was rejoined and South came flying out of the traps determined to take the game by the scruff of the neck again. It wasn't long before the tactical switch pushing newcomer Ed B forward to the left wing from right back paid off. Collecting an outlet ball from the back, Ed pushed forward exchanging passes with Boris to run rings around the static defence before Boris played in the fully recovered John Greaves to flash a shot across the SW keeper and bring the scores level 2-2.
Another short corner saw SW regain the lead against the run of play, but in a sure sign of some determination and resiliance that will stand the team in good stead for the season to come, the lead lasted mere seconds. From the restart, the ball was sent back to the Monckasaurus who unleashed a trademark crackerjack through the entire SW team to an unmarked (and vocal) Boris to collect, jink past the last remaining defender, before coolly waiting for the keeper to go to ground before teasing the SW team with a reverse stick daisy-cutter to bring South back to 3-3.
From there, we should have at least seen the game out, we even had chances to win it; but silly mistakes and some frankly disgraceful behaviour from the captain depositing his toys (and stick) across the pitch, saw South lose their cool and two quick goals in succession to further short corners. Still, the results that matter come in the league games and from the friendlies played we've surely found our strengths to utilise, weaknesses to work on removing and plenty of optimism for the season ahead.

The first scheduled gap in the M4s fixture list coincided with the half term holidays and it initially appeared that the M4s were going to be left with a bare bones side as stalwarts of the side started making excuses to sample other climes and spend some time using two sticks rather than one. However, late call ups in the form of Masters Mulley and Greaves Jnr helped to bolster a squad looking to improve their recent fortunes with a morale boosting win in this mid season friendly against a side we narrowly lost to in pre-season.

The early spring sunshine obviously appealed to the team as they set about their work with gusto and (despite the game being a friendly) went immediately went for the metaphorical jugular. With the welcome return of Charlie to partner Dave in Tom Ps absence, some varied distribution from the back saw the M4s taking the slightly unusual (for them) approach of building play up patiently from the back by knocking the ball to Ky and David in the full back positions and playing the ball up the wings via Tom R and Rasmus. It paid of handsomely as time and again the Saffron Walden defence was carved wide open as slick passing between the wingers and Nick and Wilco in the centre before attempting to feed the ball into the dangerous runs of Simon and John up front. However, the coup de grace was not to be applied within the first third of the half, despite the best efforts.

The pressure was definitely beginning to tell though as time and again, balls were being worked around the back of Saffron Walden and the shot count was mounting. Efforts from John G, Rasmus, Nick and Tom were all narrowly off target or repelled by the keeper before the inevitable goal came from one of the young guns on loan during half term. Some good interception work by Nick set Luke free and while his initial shot on the reverse was blocked, he reacted quickest in the scramble of bodies to force the ball home. 1-0 South.

South were now pouring forward at will and the second game in similar circumstances. Rasmus received the ball on the right and charged into the D before cutting the ball back. Luke (who obviously has been watching/hearing about Mr Barton's exploits with the 3s attempted another reverse stick shot that beat the keeper and clattered off the far post. Quick as a flash, Rasmus retrieved the ball and although the initial shot was hacked off the line by a covering defender, he managed to force the ball home at the second attempt. 2-0 South.

Saffron Walden started to come into the game more as they managed to force a few counter attacks as South kept coming forward sensing more goals were there to be had. South's over-confidence was to prove their undoing as Saffron Walden's No 55 seemed to kept waltzing through tackle after tackle and eventually set up their opening goal to bring the score back to 2-1.

Stung by this, South immediately went on the offensive and decided to stick with the current game plan. From the push back, the ball went back to Nick in midfield who fed the ball out wide to Tom. A quick 1-2 was played with Simon, providing the extra man down the left and putting the tricky right back out of the play. Tom then fired a peach of a cross into the D for the unmarked Boris to set himself and slot past the helplessly exposed keeper and restoring South's 2 goal lead. 3-1

South's collective tail was well and truly up now and everyone wanted to get in on the act. The fourth goal came from some superb individual play from Nick who on collecting the ball just outside the 25, jinked past two defenders on his way into the D before dispatching the ball to score Souths 4th of the game and the 4th of the half. Dream stuff for the 4s!

Still, we weren't finished. With the South midfield rampant, the defence lacking much to do as the rare attacks forward from Saffron Walden were swiftly repelled the Monckasaurus was getting bored and sensed he was missing out on much of the fun upfront. Coming forward into the spaces in midfield, he suddenly saw a gap wider than the Grand Canyon and shelled a trademark ball forward. Unfortunately the target, Simon was so surprised to find himself both unattended at the top of the D and with no obvious defensive prescence near him, completely failed to trap the ball cleanly and the chance was lost. Too good to be true, clearly we wouldnt get another chance like that?

Obviously, Saffron Walden had also switched off at this point as minutes later, the same gap appeared and another ball was smashed forward. This time the skipper was prepared and spinning into the D, produced what is becoming a trademark flick into the bottom corner to bring up South's 5th goal and register his 6th goal in as many games, although far too late to make a run on Barton's lead as Goal King.

This clearly woke up the opposition though as a cry of ""They've got nothing except a long ball!"" was met with hoots of derision and the retort ""Nothing but 5 goals you mean!"" which also ignored the fact only one goal had actually come from a long ball. However, it would be Saffron Walden who would have the final say as they finished the half by applying some real pressure on the South defence. A series of long corners was repelled until an errant foot caught the ball. The ball however fell kindly for a Saffron Walden player and with the umpire seeing the advantage, play was allowed to continue and the shot registered Saffron Walden's second goal and bought half time with it.

While more of the same was urged from the captain during the team talk, the word coming from the defence was; ""lets keep it tight and not concede any more. If it was a league game, I'd hate to blow a lead like this."". Fair point, well made. Could we hold on, given our propensity to ship goals?

It turned out to be ""no, not entirely"". Despite several more opportunities including a string of short corners, South were struggling to find that spark from the first half and couldn't increase their lead. Saffron Walden though clearly regrouped from the first half and went out as though it was 0-0. They soon found their way through our defence when failing a poor clearance from the back, they found their way through to open the scoring for the second half and make it 5-3.

The game was much more even now and possession was favouring the home side more. Several last ditch tackles from the defence from short corners and some fabulous stops from Shahzad (who got several nominations in the MoM voting) kept Saffron Walden at bay. Counter-attacking became the key for South although we weren't getting as many breaks as we would have liked but they were coming.

Boris and John combined well to create several openings, but the Saffron Walden defence were having a much better half and mopping things up. Several opportunites came and went, but the best and clearest opening of the half came when a break away down the right hand side saw Nick release Simon who had gotten into some space. Cutting into the D, he did all the hard work by beating his man by feinting right and dragging the ball left and bursting into the D. He then spoilt it all when a rush of blood to the head saw him attempt the most audacious reverse stick shot that could only be best described as a reverse stick scoop; flashing high, wide and not so very handsomely of to the right of the right hand post to the utter astonishment of everyone involved. When questioned about it afterwards, the skippers response was: ""Why not take the shot? Reverse stick shots seem to be the done thing these days and someday it just might come off."" and nearly elicted several Lemon nominations.

Was that miss to prove costly? As it turned out, not quite. Saffron Walden did manage to find a 4th goal shortly before the final whistle but not that elusive 5th and so a vital win was registered for the 4s. In an unusual twist, it turned out that the 4s were the only team to register a win across the club. Furthermore, when voting for MoM was conducted, the skipper found himself in the position of having to place his casting vote against a choice of himself or Rasmus. Then to top it all off, word came through via Twitter on Sunday that South had flattened Ely 4s 13-0. Clearly their shell-shocked skipper simply remembered arriving in Cambridge (for their game against City 5s) and then got confused over who they'd actually played in the aftermath. Still, it all helps with the goal difference at the bottom as its starting to get quite tight. With four games left and both Bourne Deeping and Ely to play (who are level and 1pt above us respectively), there's still time and the opportunity for us to claw our way back up the table and avoid from the wooden spoon. If we take the first half of this game into the next 4 games for the entire 70 minutes, it should be a piece of cake. Either way, I think we should ignore the defence when it comes to a half time team talk...

Good pressure up the middle of the pitch won South a few short corners, however unfortunately none were converted into goals.  An early effort for Lemon was made towards the end of the first half by Chris Pearson who, upon South winning a short corner, inexplicably retrieved the ball and threw it to the other end of the pitch, towards a waving Shabhaz.  A further Lemon-effort was made midway through the first half by 1s player Laurie, by turning up in a Porsche.
The match went into half time 0-0.
South started the second half with initial enthusiasm however unfortunately conceded a goal after just a few minutes from a short corner.  South heads dropped and Ely jumped on the chance to score again just minutes later.  South held their determination after the restart and persisted with closing down Ely and moving forward well on the break.
A further Lemon effort was made by Chris Pearson in the second half.  While making a break down the right wing he inexplicably threw his stick in front of him and kicked it down the pitch.  Perhaps he confused his stick with the ball?  We may never know.
Half way through the second half the pressure eventually produced a goal.  After a cutting run by guest player Chris Pearson ended in a lifted through ball to Nick, all that was needed was a cricket-style forward drive to put the ball into the middle of the net from the top of the D.  An average goal that I won't mention again.
Ely then scored again, but it was probably a scrappy goal, and easily forgotten.  Anyway, I'll not bore you with trivia and move on.
The Ely pitch was then blessed with what many present described as 'the finest hockey moment I will see in my lifetime'.  ''I can't wait to tell my grandchildren in 40 years time that I was there to witness it'' said one spectator.  ''I'm just walking my dog, I wasn't watching'' said another.  Yes, I am talking about the iconic moment that centre back Oli Culley scored a goal.  Following good pressure down the right hand side of the pitch by the right midfield, the right defence, both centre mids, the left mid, and probably the right back as well as Shabhaz, the ball was pushed up to the Ely base line ready to be crossed to the near post.  Now quite what Oli was doing so far up the pitch will be the subject of a post-season inquiry, but this should not take away from the spectacular, effortless grace with which he swept the ball over the line from half a yard out.
The shell-shocked Ely now felt the need to resort to underhand tactics by drawing a foul in the South D.  A break down their right wing saw Ron having to chase back and make an awkward tackle, unfortunately resulting in a penalty flick for a push in the back seen perhaps only by the umpire.  A low flick to Shabhaz's right made it 4-2.
The last 5 minutes of the game saw South pushing Ely hard and never giving up on getting something out of the fixture, however it wasn't to be.","Men's 2nds lose to Ely 2nds","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0
1493,"06/04/2013","League",4,49,"10:30",12,"Home","3","2","2","1","False","False","False","South M4s rocked up at Wilberforce Road to find a gentle spring sun shining down on them despite the recent weather and early start and looked at the inviting surface of the new(ish) pitch with great anticipation of a good game and hopeful win to round of the elongated season. It was then almost something of an anti-climax when the skipper was duly informed by the chairman that owing to a higher team being unable to fulfill their trip to the outer reaches of our region, the opposition were also conceding the game but hoping to play a friendly. Still, there was the incentive of an unbeaten run to protect for the 4s, so it was game faces all round as the fields took to the pitch to complete the 2012-13 season.
South started brightly and made much of the early play as both teams looked to assert the authority early on. Charlie and Tom P were breaking up play effectively and using the width provided by the returning Ed B at right back and the wily David B at left back to start the wingers Rasmus and Tom R raiding down the flanks. There was even time for Tom and Charlie to make some forays into midfield to help Jacob and Wilco as South looked to work the ball quickly through to John and Andy starting up front. However, despite a lot of promising build up play to often a timely interception from the opposition or a sloppy pass let South down.
As a result, Ely started to enjoy a spell of possession and forced a series of short corners and shooting opportunities as South suddenly found themselves pinned back in their own half. However, in scenes reminisicent of the South M3-M4 derby at the end of last season, it seemed our opposition were trying to be unneccessarily sporting in finding as many ways as possible to fail to trap the ball cleanly or generally letting an opportunity slip away. However, when they did get their shots in, some vital blocks, deflections and saves from Shahzad in goal and by defensive sticks (and the one hand; see LoM) kept South in it. However, it wasn't long before one eventually slipped through and Ely took a deserved lead.
The 4s have shown great spirit in recent games and this continued with some determined play to attempt to get the equalising goal. Several good opportunities were carved out by some excellent play from midfield as both Tom R and Simon J played through several balls that John and Simon F just failed to get on the end of. When we did, several shots flew just wide of the post as it seemed our frustration was going to get the better of us.
However, we were not to be denied. Simon J broke up another Ely attack and fed the ball to Tom R on the left. Beating his first marker and dragging a second across, he flicked the ball inside to the lurking captain who had wriggled free of his own marker, collected the ball and made a beeline for the baseline. Sprinting to offer support, Rasmus made his way into the D and called for the ball. The captain duly obliged, sending the ball towards the centre of the D, where South's Great Dane collected the ball and after seeing his first shot blocked by the keeper's pads, calmly followed up and ensure the rebound was dispatched before either keeper or defender could react to bring the scores level at 1-1.
South settled again and were carving out more opportunities to get the ball into the opposition's D. South were forcing more and more errors from the Ely players and from the resultant free hits, several meaty efforts from the stick of the Monckasaurus went begging for a touch as he tried to find that trademark ball into the danger area for the forwards to snaffle another but it wasnt quite happening despite the best efforts. Instead, it was from a break up of play, that a ball was smacked through the field from somewhere nearer his own 25, that a ball came hurtling through the congested midfield and evaded everybody's stick bar the Ely keeper. The look of shock on the hapless stoppers face as he realised what had just happened led to a collective shake of the head from Ely and although they again forced a series of shorts couldnt find a way through and the half closed with South 2-1 to the good.
The second half followed a similar pattern. South came out of the blocks quickly and went for their opponents from the off. Dave attempted to fool the opposition into thinking his assist for the second South goal was a one-off, by mishitting several clearances and free hits straight to the opposition before firing a glorious ball out of his own half towards the lurking Andy T in the opponents circle. Andy's mistimed block took enough of the pace of the ball for Rasmus to scoot round behind him to collect the ball before pulling it back for John G to tuck the ball into the goal and make the score 3-1 to South.
Ely worked tirelessly throughout the game and pulled a goal back fairly quickly to make the score 3-2, but depite turning the screw and applying more and more pressure on the home side, the defence stood firm and saw out the game. South themselves won a few short corners in the latter stages and despite those and several open play opportunities couldnt extend their lead and make the game safe. All in all, a good work out in the early morning sun against an Ely side who were very competitive and always in the game.
So, a sixth game unbeaten (5 wins and a draw) saw South M4s finish the season on a high. 6th in Div 6NWS sees us finish above St Neots 4s, Bourne Deeping 5s and our opponents Ely City 4s. Given the number of players used this season and the number of promising new players who have joined the club, things are looking good. If we can overcome our notoriously slow start to a season, who knows where we might end up next year now we've seen the back of the juggernaut that is Cambs City 5s...

Was this game destined to be a bad-tempered affair with cards aplenty? We had hoped not. 
To give us some respite during the game, we were blessed with two subs and 13 was adjudged to be a good number by Dave Monck. Our opposition looked to have a secret weapon before the game had begun, though. A mix-up with the shirts meant that St. Ives did not have their away kit (as arranged months earlier) with them, and a quick trip to the club storeroom sorted that out. However, they each slipped on their away shirts over their green kit. This was significant, as with temperatures close to zero and the odd snowflake making an appearance, St. Ives looked warmer than South, perhaps explaining why we were more eager to get the game underway.
From the start, the Cambridge South pressure seemed to be working wonders, with some high pressing forcing the errors from the St. Ives defence. When on the ball, some simple passes and good runs enabled us to get into the opposition D, and often attempt a shot. It was during one of these chances that the keeper struggled to get rid of a bobbly shot from Boris, and Tom Rosselli made sure to finish the job, and doubled his tally for the season. 1-0, and the game was looking promising, with much South possession and urgency, resulting in a lot of time spent in the St. Ives half. 
The second goal for South went in from a short corner. Another strong push-out and trap - the short corner routine seems to be getting better and better lately - and the familiar Dave Monck cannon had found its way to the backboard, taking a touch on the way. Surely there were more goals to come.
As the half came to an end, St. Ives became more of a danger with a few breaks allowing them to shoot on goal. Defenders working back, and Shahzad's persistence ensured that none of the shots were made to count. There was time for one last South chance though. A short corner was won as the whistle sounded, but despite the additional supporting players available for the routine, the shot unfortunately went wide. 
At half-time, there were shades of last weekend's goal-fest at Saffron Walden, but with two goals scored, we weren't going to sit back, so a repeat of the first half was necessary. A few of us were a little under the weather due to illness, while others noticed that the star-player/s lacked their usual spark. We needed to finish the job. The second half started strong, with the first 10-15 minutes finding South camped up in the St. Ives half, the ball didn't cross halfway. Long and short corners came and went, and a myriad of South players contributed their shots, but the ball just wouldn't go in. Though we couldn't recall the last time that so many of our shots were on target, the St. Ives keeper was on form, with his defence helping him out during one messy scramble. A short time later, a solid shot (from outside the circle?) which may have hit a foot resulted in the ball smashing into the goal, but the three umpires and video referee disallowed it unanimously.
St Ives again had a stronger spell in the latter half of the half. but the defence were holding firm. Shahzad was not excessively troubled as Dave, Charlie and Ky snuffed out any danger, and David Bridge was on hand to make some last-minute, one-armed tackles. Despite his thigh-strain coming back, Charlie was not interested in subbing off, but was promptly banned from crossing the halfway mark by Boris, as he had made some cracking runs several times earlier. This instruction was to fall on deaf ears. 
As the match came to a close, we were treated to what was a highlight of the match for some. A chance for St. Ives went begging after two of their players came together in the South circle, and the burly gents fell to the ground one on top of the other. The lower of the two took his time in getting up, and soon after, the game was over. It was a great team result, a clean sheet, and an away win against a mid-table team - not bad at all.
From the post-match analysis, it was clear that this was another good team performance from the 4ths. The MOM nominations confirmed this, with seven separate players being nominated, and Dave Monck winning a tight vote. Ultimately it was translated that he owed the MOM to ""being fairly quiet"". Well done Dave. 
On the way home, it was revealed that even Graham was impressed with the way we played, and that our disciplined positional play and lack of crowding apparently made the game easy to umpire too. [Thanks to both umpires.]
Four home games now await the most in-form Cambridge South team, including three league games with a point to prove to Bourne Deeping, Peterborough Vets and, of course, Ely.","Men's 4ths beat St Ives 5","False","False",0,1,"True","True",0

Granthams Wikipedia page also tries to lay claim to <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/paine_01.shtml"">Thomas Paine</a>, who is nearly the political polar opposite of Thatcher. This is rather stretching a point, Paines connection to the town apparently being 18 months working there. Presumably this is a sop to any local lefties, but really he remains a man of Thetford.
So Grantham, as a locality, has the right wing and left wing well covered. Pity we didnt take note during the first half as our play all seemed to occupy the centre ground, which was clogged up with too many voices/sticks all offering essentially the same spiel, leaving the poor voter/ball carrier feeling he has no real options. Grantham possibly looking more threatening, as they attempted to exploit the spaces left as our defence was sucked up the pitch in a misguided attempt to help with the attack. Particularly prominent at centre-forward was Granthams skipper, who just happens to be ex South 3rds player Benjie Groom. We werent going to let <i>him</i> score, surely? Well, not on the strong side at least, our defence opting to let the reverse look after itself... ;-)
I dont remember the home keeper being forced into many saves in the opening period. However, Lino certainly made one key one for us. It came inside the opening five minutes from The Failed Apple Dodgers first short corner [what do you mean, you dont think that is their nickname?!?]. A powerful flicked shot was heading chest high just inside the right post, but Lino got a big left hand across to glove the ball narrowly wide. Great stop.
The general consensus at half-time was that our performance had been pretty underwhelming, and we could manage more much with a more energetic display. Ali in particular emphasised workrate in closing down players attempting to clear and turning the ball over high up the park. We put it into practise right from the whistle, as a string of shorts were forced. A couple of clear chances came as a result, but they were not converted.
In fact we wouldnt take the lead until the storm seemed to have abated and the home defence pushed out. A Grantham attack had been terminated by a foul just outside our 25. Matt showed excellent speed of thought to find Tom out wide right, way before the hosts defence had got organised. Such was the space afforded, all it took was one more pass from Tom to play Rob in clean through. Rob drew the keeper out, rounded him (on the strong side!) and bashed home.
Within five minutes, we were two up as one of our shorts finally succeeded. The left slip option was finding space and time (both Joe and Tom had had good chances from this previously), so it went that way again, with Tom the recipient. Toms shot beat the keeper, but was blocked on the line. From my, admittedly distant, vantage point, this clearance may not have been via a stick. However, as the ball ran to Ali for a tap in at the far post, the need for the Umpire to make a decision was obviated. If Toms shot had indeed hit a foot, and the Umpire had seen it and was considering awarding a flick, then this was a very good advantage played.
We added one more goal in a very similar manner. Again a short was switched to Tom and his shot was saved. This time the ball was heading towards the penalty spot and a waiting defender, when Rob intervened with a diving reverse stick sweep. Spectacular finish.
Our aim for the day had been to win and thereby put what pressure we could on 5NWs top two sides. That must count as achieved, but the news filtered through that Louth and Boston had both been handed walkovers in their games. So not a great deal of tension, then. Oh well. It means Louth are now out of our reach and promoted, and catching Boston seems unlikely as they are 3 points ahead, with a much better goal difference. They just need a point in their final match to be sure of promotion, which is away to bottom side Nomads, who havent won all season. The perfect time for our cross-town rivals to change that stat, isnt it? We will have to make the short trip to Newmarket for our last game, do our level best to win and cross our fingers.","Men's 3rds beat Grantham 1","False","False",0,1,"True","False",0

South worked really hard in midfield to frustrate the Uni moves, making those 50-50 balls and with some good linking play with the forwards. It was a fast-paced game, with both teams breaking and the ball pinging about the pitch. Neither side broke the deadlock, and it was 0-0 at half time.

That was far from guaranteed though; St. Ives 3rds were only two points behind us, with a superior goal difference. If they won, we also had to win to stay ahead. Technically, there was still a chance of second and the cast-iron promotion spot it brings, but that relied on results that were never a realistic possibility.
This was the third attempt to play this fixture, and it was nearly stymied again by a hole that some vandal had dug in Newmarkets (really pretty new and otherwise high quality) astro. It was large enough to be a serious issue to the ankles of anyone who stumbled into it. Once packed with sand the Umpires deemed it playable, so the scene was set. Could we do what we needed against our fairly local rivals? We had beaten them pretty comfortably earlier in the season, <a href=""http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-29th-september-2012.php#M3"">7-1</a>, at a time when they were struggling to come to terms with Div5 hockey. More recent results told of a team that had developed significantly and would pose a very real threat. They showed their new level almost from the opening whistle as some neat passing (and very slack marking, to be honest) saw them into our circle for an early opportunity, which drew the first of the many saves that Lino would produce on the day.
The match was swinging from end-to-end, with our front line forcing some corners, and Newmarket looking to hit on the counter with aerials and runners coming from deep. Despite the importance of the game, our work off the ball was of dubious intensity, and this was well exploited by the home side as they took the lead. A free-hit just outside our 25 was quickly taken, catching the defence dozing. It was slip right to an overlapping player, who was able to advance into the circle and shot unopposed, the ball fizzing past Lino and inside his near post.
In recent weeks, we have been poor at playing catch-up hockey, quickly descending into panic and overly direct play. So it was imperative that we drew level quickly, and fortunately that was the case. It came from a series of shorts, the last of which saw the original shot saved, only for the rebound to fall to Andy, ten yards out. Andy flicked the ball goalwards, and what it may have lacked in pace it made up for with awkward height, getting past the defenders and through the keepers dive. Phew.
The half continued with Newmarket absorbing our pressure and looking the more likely on the counter. They were unlucky when one effort was called back for an earlier awarded short, and had another two-on-one situation which saw their talented young forward advanced towards Lino, flick the ball past him and the two clatter into each other. Lino hadnt got anything on the ball, but as it was going wide and the kid had no chance of getting back to it even if he had remained upright, no further action was deemed necessary from the Umpire.
At the other end, Rob felt sawn off by a whistle for a short as a ball ricocheted nicely to him off a defensive foot. He had been able to see the whites of the keepers eyes. From the resulting set-piece, a goalmouth scramble saw Robs bobbling shot hit the post. That was the last serious action of the half, the sides turning around level.
Alis team talk had called for extra effort with the game so evenly poised, and he was rewarded by an opening press from his team that forced a string of shorts. Play was mostly in the Newmarket half of the field, and it would remain that way for the majority of the second period as we threw more and more bodies forward looking for the all-important goal. Newmarkets counters were more sporadic than previously, but no less potent for their comparative rarity. The match was definitely on a knife-edge.
It looked like we had the goal early on in the half when Joe intercepted a defensive clearance that had been heading over the byline and squared for a tap-in. But it was chalked off as the Umpire had spotted Joe had been marginally too late and the ball was actually out-of-play before he had collected it. Throughout the half we were putting crosses across the home sides goal without reward. In particular, one lovely move down the left flank which involved five players, first time passing and triangles went unrewarded as the final ball flashed through the circle untouched (pity). Other attacks foundered on hurriedly taken shots from promising positions, in a manner that suggested the forwards were feeling the pressure.
Time was rapidly ebbing away, until with about five minutes left an attempted pass broke kindly for Jan, up so far from right-back that he was inside the circle, level with the forwards (it had got rather desperate). Jan received, rolled his man and found himself in on the keeper. With the stopper advancing, he squared across the face, Rob getting a poke on the ball that sent it just inside the far post. Relief unbounded.
However, there was still long enough left to throw it away. We tried our best, giving up three shorts in the next two minutes. The initial shots caused no major alarms, but a recycled ball from one of them was a serious threat as one of the hosts main danger men (and I think the scorer of the opening goal) was left unchallenged and shooting from an angle. Again he made solid, undercutting contact, necessitating the final fine save of the day from Lino, who then berated his defence for not closing down the opportunity.
A misplaced pass from the resulting long gave us a 16, and this time we managed to clear our lines, finding Rob on halfway via Johnny B and Jan. A sweeping move developed with Rob's weighted pass into the corner finding Andy, who stood his man up and cut inside, pulling the ball back for Olly, arriving in support. Olly found Rob in the circle, whose shot was blocked by a defender. It ran free to Ali, arriving late at the left post, and he swept into the seemingly gapping net. However, the Newmarket keeper, who had gone to ground trying to deal with Rob s shot, somehow managed to regain his feet, hurl himself full length and make an extraordinary stick save. The whack to the back of the head from the astro the keeper got for his pains hardly seemed fair for one of the best saves of any hockey match Ive been involved with.
After a pause to see if the stopper was OK, play resumed for the final handful of seconds, with the ball not emerging from Newmarkets half. So we had won. As the other scores came through, the importance of the result was confirmed; St. Ives 3rds had also won 2-1, so if we had drawn they would have leapfrogged us. Boston had won as expected to confirm 2nd place, as had Louth who thereby claimed the title. Only six points separates 1st from 4th in the final table after one of the closest promotion battles around the East League.
Our final points total was 48, with a record of 15-3-4 from 22 games, i.e. a 2-in-3 win rate. Pretty decent for a side only promoted into this Division for this season. An interesting aside (well, <i>I</i> think its interesting) is that it is our away form that has carried us to promotion [if indeed promotion happens, unlike our <a href=""https://twitter.com/cambsouthhc/status/323103604280004608"">club twitter account</a> Im holding back slightly until  next years Divisions are published]. Our only home win since Christmas came via a walkover, with just one other point gained in Cambridge. By contrast our away form in 2013 is played five, won five. Indeed across the season we have picked up more points away from home than at home. This is fairly unusual for amateur sport, and has only happened because of a high level of commitment from the core squad, with the skippers only usually needing to make one or two changes per game. Hopefully we can manage the same next season.
<h2>2012-13 squad notes</h2>
Im using Championship Manager positional notations, with the adaptation that a players regular position is in bold [regular not preferred. My own preferred position is centre-forward, but can I convince a Captain to let me play there? Can I hell...] and all other positions he can play in plain text;
Chris Collinson - <b>Gk</b> - 5 apps, 2 clean sheets - Our keeper through the Div 6NW(s) promotion season and the opening half of this campaign, until he left to a) go travelling and then b) go to Uni. Capable of high quality reflex saves. Those that saw will long remember the flash of pink Astros as he <a href=""http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201112/reports-10th-march-2012.php#M3"">riverdanced around the St. Neots pitch</a>.
Lino Di Lorenzo - The Cat, The Prodigal - <b>Gk</b> - 6 apps, 1 clean sheets - A more than adequate replacement for Chris, Lino has returned to the action after nearly <i>four years</i> out with injury. He even managed to keep a clean sheet once his defence refrained from giving away a penalty stroke per game. An excellent keeper who was playing for the 2nds prior to his sabbatical, strong on both shot stopping and organising the defence in front of him, he may be the best goalie playing regularly in Division 5.
John Benedikz - Johnny B, JB - Gk/<b>Sw</b>D <b>C</b> - 19 apps, 5 clean sheets - Vice-captain, vice-goalkeeper. A mass of vices, to tell you the truth. Also chief administrator, debt-collector and not least defensive rock. As a defender he is a fine reader of the game and generally intercepts rather than tackles, although he is perfectly capable of whipping the ball off a forwards stick if he needs to. Has many Div3 games under his belt from previous years, so it is always encouraging to see him lining-up at the middle of our back-line. No goals this season though, which is unusual for a(nother) frustrated centre-forward. Also fills in decently as keeper when our regular stopper is not available and neither Parky or Shahbaz can double-up.
Jan Brynjolffssen - <b>D R</b> - 20 apps, 1 goal, 5 clean sheets - Appearance leader for the season. Mr Reliable at right-back, first name on the teamsheet, an accomplished defender who never makes a mistake. Knows exactly how hockey should be played, and isnt shy about saying so. Statistical expert, who provides constant information for which the entire team are always truly grateful. Also writes superb match reports and pen pics and is unfailingly modest.
Ian Glover - <b>D RL</b> - 8 apps, 3 clean sheets - Former 2nd teamer who dropped down to us as his availability became patchy following the birth of his first kid. Possibly the one defender we have who possesses pace. As someone who has shown himself capable of playing at a higher level, his presence is always welcome, when he can make it. But having seen Julies return for the L1s - it looked like she had never been away - there might be competing claims chez Glover for who plays hockey on a Saturday next season.
Neil Sneade - <b>D L</b>C - 16 apps, 4 clean sheets, 1 yellow card - Mr Cambridge South, inveterate tweeter and ultra-reliable left or centre back. Has fewer appearances for us than might be expected, simply because the 2nds called him up whenever they had a long distance away game! Solid tackler and often displays skills and spins that allow him to break out when oppositions try and box him in, launching attacks down our left side. Even had a go in goal this season when no-one else was willing and he wasnt fit enough to play outfield. He was better at it than Wilco... May have made history by scoring <a href=""http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-1st-september-2012.php#M3"">the first ever own goal in British hockey</a> when turning the ball past Parky at 10:50am on the day the rules changed, and collected our only yellow card of the season for the heinous crime of kicking the ball somewhere near the halfway line.
Paul South - <b>D C</b> - 19 apps, 1 goal, 5 clean sheets - One of South 3rds most committed players who only missed games this season due to injury. Does nothing half-hearted on the field, be it challenging for the ball or debating with the opposition. In spite of all the efforts of opposition teams this season, his most difficult matchday task has been to extricate his son from bed. Also know for stream-of-consciousness emails that closely resemble hippy poetry.
Stu Creed - The Doctor of Dribble - D/<b>M</b>/F <b>R</b>LC - 12 apps, 1 goal - The ultimate utility man, who South captains have long been comfortable putting pretty well anywhere, bar central defence or keeper. Good tackler, hard worker, at his best when carrying the ball in from the right side, using those dribbling skills to cut through opposing defences. <a href=""http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-29th-september-2012.php#M3"">Suffers from a possible eye problem that requires the use of sunglasses during play</a>. Missed a significant chunk of the season due to a broken rib suffered against Grantham, though he finished that game, unable to diagnose the problem! Physician, heal thyself.
Andrew Fraser - <b>M</b>/F <b>RL</b>C -10 apps, 2 goals - Teenager who first came into the 3rds squad towards the end of 11-12 season and has developed significantly since, to the point where he now bounces between us and the 2nds. A hard-working and skilful midfielder, he provide the key contribution to your report writers nomination for goal of the season; at <a href=""http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-17th-november-2012.php#M3"">home against Ely</a>, he went on a 50 yard run down the left touchline, beating three players and then finished it by hammering down on the ball on his reverse side to ping a beautiful cross that gave Rob the time and space in the circle to finish. He will be sorely missed next season as he is off to Uni.
Simon Jelley- Jelley, The Jelleyman - D/<b>M</b>/F <b>L</b> - 11 apps, 1 goal  - Ex-captain, who lead the team to promotion from Div6 last season, Jelley dropped down to the 4ths at the Christmas break partly as he was struggling for confidence, but also to provide the 4ths midfield with technical ability and experience. Appreciates exactly what a team needs to do to get promoted from their league, so his know-how will be key. 4ths record before Jelley joined them was 2 wins, 2 draws, 10 defeats and since then it has been 5 wins, 1 draw, 2 defeats. Not entirely all his doing but not entirely coincidental either.
Matt Kern - D/<b>M</b>/F <b>C</b> - 18 apps, 4 goals - Player of the season, Matt patrols the centre of midfield, giving the team a strong lynchpin to play around. The perfect midfielder as he doesnt look out of place when asked to fill-in in either defence or attack, tenacious when challenging for the ball and cool when presented with a goalscoring opportunity. About the only drawback with Matt is his commitment seems to result in at least one painful blow per game from ball, body or stick. All can be taken in good humour, possibly excepting the occasion when the ball was <a href=""http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-8th-december-2012.php#M3"">smacked into his arse <i>by a teammate</i></a>!
Olly Lamming - <b>M RLC</b> - 9 apps, 2 goals - Promoted from the 4ths squad at the start of the season, it took Olly a couple of matches to adapt to the pace of our game, but once he did so he put in a string of fine performance that happened to correspond with our best team performances of the season. Brings energy and dribbling skills to the midfield, and also always brings a supporter with him, which has the effect of doubling the crowd whenever he plays. Football club chairman pay through the nose for such individuals...
Tom South - The Five-Toed Sloth - D/<b>AM</b> RL<b>C</b> - 17 apps, 6 goals - Our most skilful player, and Lemon-of-the-Season. Possesses a surprising  turn of pace and is capable of ripping open opposition defences on his own when the mood takes him. He probably has the most potential of any player in the  current squad. Second top scorer (if one includes friendlies) and almost certainly top assist man (but we dont record that stat).  Only drawback is an advanced case of narcolepsy, the apogee of which was turning up <a href=""http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-12th-january-2013.php#M3"">late for a home match on a pitch round the corner from his house when the push-back was 3pm!</a> His impressive commitment to sleeping also lead to the rare feat of being Lemon-of-the-Match for <a href=""http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-9th-march-2013.php#M3"">two</a> <a href=""http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-9th-march-2013.php#M4"">different</a> South sides on the same day. Off to Uni next year, when such behaviour will be exceptional and not tolerated. Wait a second... Someone had better make sure he takes vitamin D pills with him, a vampyric type existence is in the offing.
James Tanner - JT- D/<b>DM C</b> - 16 apps - Leader, legend, future captain? New to the club this season, and a real find. Brilliant in the tackle, comfortably the best in our side and one of the best club-wide (I would say almost on a Parsot or Gravelling level) and has the best technique on the ball of our squad. Also a visionary passer of the hockey ball. Or possibly hallucinatory? Often on a different, higher wavelength than his teammates, who end up staring after his through-balls as they race out of play going Wow, man, did you dig that? It was <i>beauuutiful</i>.
Joe Whitaker - <b>M</b>/F RL<b>C</b> - 9 apps, 1 goal - Promoted from the 4ths midway through the campaign and quickly became an integral part of the side. Got to play up front on a couple of occasions and showed extreme promise, along with a scorching undercut. This provided one of our more important goals this term, a quick equaliser when we had gone behind <a href=""http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-9th-february-2013.php#M3"">away at St. Ives 3s</a>. Adds youth (well, mid-20s but that does move our average age downwards!) and energy to the midfield and forward areas.
Rob Barton - 'Lord Barton of the Reverse-Stick (with pike)' - <b>S C</b> - 19 apps, 31 goals - Goal machine, and the probably difference between a promotion chasing season and a mid-table one (or worse?). Dropped (himself) down from the 2nds last summer, and instantly made us much more likely to convert circle penetrations into goals. First seven goals this season all came from the patented reverse stick sweep with arse-over-tit fall, but from then on he added more variety. Can he repeat the trick next year? Will he score more on the front stick than the reverse? Will keepers get wise to him? And is Just For Men all that keeps him from being slate grey?
David Doup - The Disappeared, #1 - <b>S C</b> - 3 apps, 2 goals - Clever striker who would dovetail nicely with Sir Barton in our new 4-4-2 formation. A good finisher but more selfless than Rob, he provides a steady stream of assists as well as goals. Went AWOL some time prior to Christmas, and has been missed since. We presume he is OK, and would like to see him back in a green shirt at some point...
Ali Edge - AM/<b>F</b> R<b>L</b> -18 apps, 5 goals - Skipper and colossus (metaphorical). Has lead South 3rds brilliantly this season, as evidence by our breaking of team records left, right and centre. Adaptable in mid-game if the formation isnt working and keeps it positive in the teamtalks, batting down some of the more negative voices in the team. With a stick in his hand, he is a lively winger, capable and comfortable playing on either side of an attacking three or wide in a four-man midfield. Chips in with goals when an opportunity arises, but his focus is more on assists. Was forced, due to multiple injuries and feeling the responsibility of skippering, into defence on one occasion and looked a bit lost, proving he is most effective at the other end of the field. Needs to study benevolent dictatorship as a governmental system.
Rupert Espley - <b>F R</b>LC - 16 apps, 6 goals - Rather than a scorer of lots of goals, Rupert instead proved himself to be the scorer of big goals. Of his six, two in particular stand out as utterly fundamental to our season, both against St. Ives 3rds. First, there was the equaliser scored inside the final 10 seconds of our <a href=""http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-20th-october-2012.php#M3"">3-3 home draw</a>. Then there was the winner in our <a href=""http://www.cambridgesouthhockeyclub.co.uk/pages/reports/season-201213/reports-9th-february-2013.php#M3"">2-1 victory at their place</a>. Given the final margin between the sides was just two points, without either strike the finishing positions would have been reversed.
John Parker - 'The Disappeared, #2' - <b>F RLC</b> - 2 apps - Another, like David, who adds skill to the attack but has vanished since the New Year.
